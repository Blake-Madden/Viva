# Run a healthy OKR program with Viva Goals

Microsoft Viva Goals is a goal-setting solution that aligns teams to your organization’s strategic priorities to drive results and create a culture of engaged employees focused on achieving common goals. 

The following articles are designed to help support you as you build a healthy OKR program for your company, which can deliver incredible benefits, including stronger alignment, increased focus, goal transparency, team adaptability, and strategic growth. 

## What are these “Solutions” articles and when are they most helpful?

Support for running a successful OKR program can often be broken down into two areas: 

1. **Understanding the OKR Software:** Microsoft Viva Goals is the software solution that helps you manage your OKRs. If you’re looking for short, step-by-step instruction (often with a quick video tutorial) to perform tasks in the software, visit the following:

    Example questions: 
    - How do I enter my OKRs into Viva Goals? 
    - How do I configure OKR permissions? 

2. **Understanding the OKR Methodology and Best Practices:** If you’re looking for assistance with broader questions around how to use OKRs and align with best practices, explore these Solutions articles. These articles provide the necessary context and detail to run a successful program. 
    
    Example questions: 
    - What is a good framework for writing effective OKRs, along with examples? 
    - How do I incorporate OKRs and dashboards into my existing rhythm of business? 

Of course, these two areas go hand-in-hand, with the methodology supporting the software, and the software supporting the methodology.
