# Complex organizations and insights

Complex organizations are Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) customers who use multiple Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenants. The following two reasons are primarily why your organization has this type of configuration:

- [Mergers and acquisitions](#mergers-and-acquisitions)
- [Conglomerates](#conglomerates)

## Mergers and acquisitions

A business merger between two companies resulting in an organization made up with multiple Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenants and separate Azure ADs. The tenants either choose to remain separate and collaborate together or merge into a single tenant.

The following shows how mergers and acquisitions require the use of two tenants.

:::image type="content" source="images/merger-and-acquisition.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a diagram of two tenants.":::

## Conglomerates

A conglomerate is a corporation made up of several independent subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are tenants that have separate Azure AD and will collaborate together and remain separate.

The concept of conglomerates is as follows.

:::image type="content" source="images/conglomerate.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows different tenants in a conglomerate.":::

## Purpose of this article

Complex organizations represent challenges for deriving insights. Often, the task falls to analyzing each of the tenants that make up the complex organization independently and comparing them manually. The process can be highly manual in nature. This article provides a growing number of examples that explain how to overcome manual processes. These examples also include those that lead to output visualizations.

## Use Viva Insights

Microsoft Viva Insights provide information and research-based behavioral insights into how an organization gets work done:

- Some examples of the works to get done are:

  - How to enhance organizational agility
  - How to boost employee engagement
  - How to improve agility
  - How to foster innovation

Advanced analytics for organizations comprised of multiple Viva Insights tenants can be enabled by:

- Combining the data in a central location
- Combining that data with other data sources

A few starter use cases that would be enabled by this data combination strategy are:

- Identify collaboration patterns between two distinct business groups (tenants)

  :::image type="content" source="images/use-case-1.png" alt-text="Illustration of the collaboration patterns between two distinct business groups":::

- Distinguish collaboration patterns between cross business groups (tenants) as compared to true external interactions.

  :::image type="content" source="images/use-case-2.png" alt-text="Illustration of distinctive collaboration patterns":::

- Data combined from Viva Insights with external sources to address headcount planning, employee well-being, permanent remote work, inclusion and diversity, and so on.
  
  :::image type="content" source="images/use-case-3.png" alt-text="Illustration that shows data combined from Viva Insights with external sources.":::

There are different ways to create a data pipeline to copy data from the source to the destination. There are also different data storage locations that can be used, such as storage accounts, SQL databases, synapses, and so on. An example leveraging Azure data factory, Viva Insights organizational data, and Azure blob storage will be described in the following sections with a [Business Continuity](../insights/Tutorials/power-bi-bc.md) use case.

## Preconditions

The following preconditions are to be fulfilled, prior to continuing with its analytical process using Microsoft Viva Insights:

### Organizational data

Organizational data is a key requirement for Viva Insights and further advanced analysis. The organizational data relates to attributes such as employee's title, manager, group, level, and so on. The organizational data that is generally required is further described in [Viva Insights prepare organizational data](../insights/Use/organizational-data.md).

To enable advanced analysis, the following schema can be used in the file that is uploaded into Viva Insights:

> [!NOTE]
> The schema should be the same between tenants.

|Attribute Name  |Attribute Description  |
|---------|---------|
|EffectiveDate     |      Date for which the given attribute value applies for the employee. The attribute applies until another record for the same attribute with a different effective date is specified.   |
|PersonId    | Unique identifier for the employee record. This identifier can be the employee's primary SMTP address or email alias. It must be in a simplified format that contains no spaces. For example,  the format **person.name@contoso.com** is allowed; however, the format **<Name, Person> (person.name@contoso.com)** is not allowed.     |
|ManagerId    |  Unique identifier for the employee’s manager, which is needed to correctly calculate metrics for time spent with managers and their direct reports. This identifier can be the manager's primary SMTP address or email alias. It must be in a simplified format that contains no spaces. For example,  the format **person.name@contoso.com** is allowed; however, the format **<Name, Person> (person.name@contoso.com)** is not allowed.      |
|Organization    |    The internal organization that the employee belongs to. An employee’s organization will be specific to the individual needs and could be identified by the leader of the organization, or by another naming convention. This data is needed to correctly calculate metrics for redundancy and insularity.     |
|FunctionType  |    The job function that the employee performs. This job function is specific to the organization. This data is used to filter and group reports, and for grouping of data in [Explore the stats](../insights/Use/explore-intro.md) features.     |
|LevelDesignation    |      The employee’s level, which is represented as a string. This level is specific to the organization and can represent an employee’s experience or management level, or seniority within the organization. This data is needed to correctly calculate metrics for redundancy and insularity.   |
|Layer     |      The place where the employee is within the organizational hierarchy. Layer is represented as an integer and expressed as the distance the employee is from the top leader of the organization. For example, the CEO is at layer 0. This data is used to filter and group reports, and for grouping of data in [Explore the stats](../insights/Use/explore-intro.md) features.   |
|SupervisorIndicator     |    The attribute used to view the habits of people managers or influencers in the organization in Power BI visualizations. This attribute powers the Overview table, the Workload charts that are generated when you use a [template](../insights/Tutorials/Power-bi-templates.md) that requires this attribute. This attribute indicates the manager status of each employee as **IC** (individual contributor), **Mngr** (manager), or **Mngr+** (manager of managers); however, if a different nomenclature is used in the file, you must update the Power BI chart filters accordingly. If you include SupervisorIndicator, you must also include the values **IC**, **Mngr**, or **Mngr+** in the organizational data. |
|TimeZone     |    Time zone in which the employee works. This attribute must be one of the time zones in [Time zones for Workplace Analytics](../insights/Use/Timezones-for-workplace-analytics.md). If no time zone is mapped to for an employee, the system will use the default time zone, which is Pacific Standard Time.     |
|TenantInd     |    Unique name for the Tenant. For example, TenantA, TenantB, TenantC, and so on.     |
|Location   |     Geographic region or other location detail.    |
|HashId    |      Unique Hashed identifier for the employee. This attribute enables further advanced analysis on the Viva Insights query results.   |

With the schema in the above table being used in the file, the analysis output from the uploaded file can be joined with other data sources (for example, sales data and zoom data) for an advanced analysis.

Additional instructions for preparing organizational data for Viva Insights are available [here](../insights/Setup/Prepare-organizational-data.md). 

**Example:  Sample of an organizational data file**

:::image type="content" source="images/sample-organizational-data-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample of a file that contains organizational data.":::

### Viva Insights Business Continuity dashboard

Set up the [Business Continuity](../insights/Tutorials/power-bi-bc.md) dashboard for your tenant with the following modification:

-	In the **Organizational data** section of the **Business Continuity and Hourly Collaboration** report, add **HashId** and **TenantInd** columns to the list. More columns can be added for this report if needed, for analysis. The following shows what attributes to select:
    :::image type="content" source="images/organizational-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Organizational data section of the Business Continuity and Hourly Collaboration report":::

### Azure

For [Ad hoc with OData](#ad-hoc-using-odata-approach) and [Automated Data Pipeline](#automated-data-pipeline), you will need:

- An application registration
- Registered application's secret for each tenant from which you are planning to pull Viva Insights query results.

You will also need an Azure subscription to host the data from the two tenants.

1. To register an application, accomplish Steps 1 to 5 in the [Automate Exports](automate-exports.md) for each tenant.
    1. To obtain a secret for the registered application, select **Certificates & secrets** from your newly registered application in Azure Active Directory.
        1. For Key authentication, select **New client** secret and in **Add a client** secret, enter a description, select when it expires, and select **Add**. In **Client** secrets, select the new secret value, and select the **Copy** icon to copy the value.
    2. Make a note of the Application ID and secret that are created for each tenant.
2. In the case of Microsoft Azure subscription, perform the following steps:
    1. Deploy custom deployment from arm template.
    1. Configure the deployed resources.

The template creates the following resources:

- Resource group
- Key vault
- Storage Account
- Azure data factory using managed identity

(The example of a privilege that allows for creation of the above resources is Azure Administrator.)

## Solution samples

The case of using query data from Viva Insights from multiple tenants, the following are a few sample solutions.

### Ad hoc manual approach

Viva Insights queries can be executed and the output can be [downloaded](../insights/Use/View-download-and-export-query-results.md) and further analyzed offline.
This sample will be using the **Business Continuity** report listed in the **Requirements** section.
There are no other pipeline setup requirements.

:::image type="content" source="images/adhoc-manual-approach.png" alt-text="Illustration of the instance of ad hoc manual approach":::

### Ad hoc using OData approach

Viva Insights queries can be scheduled to auto refresh and accessed via [OData links](../insights/Use/View-download-and-export-query-results.md) to provide further analysis or to be visualized in PowerBi reports. 
This sample will be using the **Business Continuity** report listed in the **Requirements** section.
There are no other pipeline setup requirements.

:::image type="content" source="images/adhoc-using-OData-approach.png" alt-text="Illustration of the instance of ad hoc OData approach":::

### Automated data pipeline

Viva Insights queries can be scheduled to auto refresh and downloaded to a central data store location for further analysis or visualizations. The solution sample uses Azure blob storage. 
This sample will be using the **Business Continuity** report listed in the **Requirements** section.
The setup details are available [here](#data-pipeline---automated).

## Visualize with PowerBi

Visualization with PowerBi can be implemented in many ways. PowerBi supports several data sources such as local storage, Azure blob storage, and OData sources.

The Business Continuity PBI report file can be used as an example of the following type:

- A file that can be downloaded from Viva Insights and modified to support multiple tenants as data sources.

To download the report, you can download the PBI template for the [Business Continuity](../insights/Tutorials/power-bi-bc.md) report you executed as part of the preconditions.

Once you have downloaded the report and the data sources have been modified, the report can show visualizations across the two tenants. See the following for some example screenshots.

**Example 1**

To obtain an insight into the look of the report by a tenant, perform the following steps:

1. In the **Settings** screen, from the **Select an organizational attribute to view the report by** drop-down list, choose the Tenant identifier attribute.
   :::image type="content" source="images/selecting-tenant-identifier-pages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Settings screen in a Power BI report.":::
