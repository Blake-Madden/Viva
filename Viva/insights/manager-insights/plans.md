# Plans for managers

Plans in advanced insights can help you transform Viva Insights analysis into targeted change plans across your team. The following targeted change plans are available for reducing meeting load, increasing focus time, and maintaining work-life balance, among other goals.

* **Focus** - Help team members get more time to do deep work and reclaim their calendar for work that matters most.
* **Collaboration** - Help team members reduce the number of excess meetings that the group schedules.
* **Wellbeing** - Help team members unwind and protect their personal time by disconnecting in their off hours.

> [!Note]
> Plans are not available within the Microsoft Viva Insights app.

You can do the following with plans:

1. [Launch a plan](#launch-a-plan) for the identified group, who experience the plan through their [personal insights](../personal/mya-landing-page.md).
2. [Manage and track a plan's progress](#manage-and-track-plans) while it is underway, and the ROI of the plan after it ends.

## Launch a plan

1. In an applicable insight, such as **After-hours**, **Long and Large meetings**, or **Focus Insights**, select **View recommended plan**.
2. If prompted, select **Validate** to confirm the team meets the minimum group size.
3. Optionally, you can select the **Edit** (pencil) icon next to **Plan name**, **Plan duration**, and **Plan target** to change the details for this plan.
4. Select **Create plan** to start the selected plan. Or you can select **Save as draft** to start the plan at a later date. The following shows an example Collaboration plan.

## Manage and track plans

In **Plans** > **Manage**, you can select to view **Drafts**, **Active**, or **Completed** plans. You can then:

* Delete or edit draft plans.
* Track or end active plans.
* Delete or track completed plans.

In **Plans** > **Track** > **Progress for**, you can select an active or a completed plan to measure progress of a target goal or ROI for the plan.

## Plan participants' experience

The actual work of change is done by your team through Viva Insights. The group or team who you are included in a plan have the opportunity to change workplace habits for the better.

During a plan, these participants receive or can view the following items.

### Dashboard

The [Dashboard](../personal/use/dashboard-2.md) is a constantly available resource for users. In addition to its standard content, the dashboard also includes a new participant section during a plan. This section contains information such as recommended habits and the participant's progress against the plan goals, similar to the following:

### Digest emails

All Viva Insights users receive a biweekly [digest emails](../personal/use/email-digests-3.md). In addition to the standard content, the participants digests will also include a section that summarizes their progress in the plan.

### Inline suggestions

Inline suggestions in Outlook are brief, data- and AI-driven notifications that appear in Outlook while you are either reading or composing an email or a meeting invitation. Different inline suggestions apply to different situations. For example, if you have outstanding to-do tasks, an inline suggestion might ask whether you want to review them.

Some inline suggestion apply only to participants of an active plan. For example, the Improve wellbeing suggestion applies only to participants in an active Wellbeing plan. The remaining suggestions in the following table are available to all Viva Insights users in your organization, whether they are participating in an active plan or not.

| Inline suggestion | Where it shows up  | What it says | How it helps  |
| ------ |------ |-------|---------|
|Improve wellbeing  |Reading pane (meeting invitation)   | Looks like this meeting is outside your typical working hours.
