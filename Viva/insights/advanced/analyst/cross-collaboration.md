# Cross-collaboration queries

Cross-collaboration queries help you learn more about how parts of your organization collaborate with others.  When you run a cross-collaboration query, your results show how pairs of individuals or groups interact.

To run a query about collaboration between two individuals in your organization (person-to-person query), refer to [Collaboration between individuals](./cross-collaboration-p2p.md).

>[!Note]
>Right now, collaboration between individuals (person-to-person query) is available for you to run in the advanced insights app. Over time, we're rolling out other query types to analyze collaboration between groups. Stay tuned on our [Insights Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-insights/ct-p/VivaInsights) to learn when the other query types are released.
