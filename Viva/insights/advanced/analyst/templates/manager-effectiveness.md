# Manager effectiveness report

The **Manager effectiveness report** uses a template populated by Microsoft Viva Insights data to analyze people-manager behaviors in your organization. HR analysts can use this analysis to measure behaviors and trends of people managers across four key themes within your organization: manager capacity, coach, empower, connect, and model.

Each theme includes insights about manager effectiveness and ways to help maintain or increase preferred leadership behaviors. Key metrics are used to deep-dive into each theme, along with a **Why this matters** interpretation and best practices recommended by industry experts.

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Manager effectiveness** query in Viva Insights.

## Demonstration

The following demonstration uses sample data that’s only representative of this report and might not be exactly what you see in a live report specific to your organization's unique data.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the queries and populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to:

* Be assigned the role of **Insights Analyst** in Viva Insights.
* Have the June 2022 (or newer) version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/getting-started-with-power-bi/) to download and install the latest version.

## Report setup

### Run query

>[!Note]
> For this release of Viva Insights, this report is currently only available in English and will only work with data generated from the English version of Viva Insights.

1. In the Viva Insights analyst experience, select **Analysis**.

2. Under **Power BI templates**, navigate to **Manager effectiveness** and select **Start analysis**. To get more information about the Manager effectiveness template before running your analysis, select **Learn more**.

    ![Query start](/viva/insights/advanced/images/me-pbi-start.png)

3. Under **Query setup**:
    1. Type a **Query name**.
    1. Select a **Time period**. **Time period** defaults to **Last 3 months**.
    1. Optional: You can set the query to automatically update by checking the **Auto-refresh** box. When you select the **Auto-refresh** option, your query automatically runs and computes a new result every time Viva Insights gets updated collaboration data for licensed people.

    >[!Note]
    >If the organizational data used in an auto-refreshing query changes (for example, an attribute name is altered or an attribute is removed), you might see an error when you run the query.

    4. Optional: Type a **Description**.
    
        Selecting **More settings** brings you to a pane, but there’s nothing you need to change there. In this pane:

        * Power BI queries are set to **Group by Week**. You can't edit this field.
        * The **Metric rules** field defaults to **Meeting exclusions rule (preferred rule)**. This field isn’t customizable in this release; for more information, refer to [Metric rules](../metric-rules.md).

4. **In Predefined template metrics**, leave prepopulated metrics as they appear.  
![Predefined metrics](/viva/insights/advanced/images/me-pbi-predefined-metrics.png)

    >[!Note]
    > Metrics in Power BI templates can't be edited in this release of Viva Insights. To expand the full list of metrics included in the Power BI template, select the arrow in the box beneath **Metrics, filters, and organizational attributes**.

5. You can filter the employees in scope for the report under **Select which employees you want to include in the query**. Don’t remove the predefined “Is Active” filter. For more details about filter and metric options, see [Create a Custom Person query](../person-query.md).
![Is active filter](/viva/insights/advanced/images/pbi-templates-isactive-filter.png)

6. Under **Select which employee attributes you want to include in the query**, add up to seven organizational attributes. After the query runs, you can use these attributes to group and filter the reports.

    >[!Important]
    >Some employee attributes are required to set up this Power BI template, which are preselected for you in the query. *Don't remove any preselected attributes.*
    >
    >If you see attributes marked in red and the query’s **Run** button disabled, it means that these required attributes are missing from your organizational data. Contact your admin to upload them.

7. Select **Run** on the upper right side of the screen, which can take a few minutes to complete.

8. When your query results are ready, go to the **Query results** page and select the **Power BI** icon to download the Power BI template and copy the query identifier. You'll need the query identifier later.
