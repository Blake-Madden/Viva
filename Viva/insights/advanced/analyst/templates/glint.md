# Glint with Viva Insights report

The **Viva Insights with Glint** report connects sentiment data from Glint and collaboration data from Viva Insights. 

With this report, you can:

* Investigate how employee sentiment and behavioral collaboration patterns might be correlated.
* Visualize trends for behavioral data.
* Average behavioral metrics, which are broken down by sentiment favorability.

Before we get started, here are a few things you should know:

* Your survey data will import from Glint to Viva Insights through an API. Your admin needs to set up this connection. 
* For this private preview, the report is only available in English.

To populate the report in Power BI, youâ€™ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Viva Insights with Glint** query in Viva Insights.
