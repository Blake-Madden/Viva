# Ways of working report

The **Ways of working report** uses a template populated by Viva Insights data to conduct a broad diagnostic of a company’s collaboration culture and employee experience. It’s designed to highlight collaboration patterns for different groups and organizational levels and to identify opportunities for improvement.
The different pages in the report help you answer the following related business questions:

* Collaboration culture:
    * How does collaboration load impact after-hours?
    * How much time do people spend in different collaboration channels?
    * How does the organization spend its meeting time?
    * How much time is going toward long or large meetings?
    * Who in the organization generates the most workload by organizing meetings?
    * Can employees reclaim focus time through “compact” scheduling practices?
    * Is multitasking during meetings driven by habit or by necessity?
    * Which recurring meetings might present streamlining opportunities?
    * Are there opportunities to drive greater agility in emailing practices?

* Employee experience:
    * When does collaboration start impacting after-hours workload?
    * Who in the organization is at highest risk of burnout?
    * Is manager double-booking creating potential ripple effects across the company?
    * Are employees receiving sufficient 1:1 coaching time?
    * Are managers balancing oversight with employee empowerment and autonomy?
    * What managerial behaviors predominate across the company and by organization?

Each report includes **What to examine** and **Why it matters** interpretations. These interpretations explain how to: 

* Analyze the report’s data to answer the business questions listed earlier.
* Use best practices to maintain or improve company collaboration patterns and employee experience.

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Ways of working** query in Viva Insights.

## Demonstration

The following demonstration uses sample data that’s only representative of this report and might not be exactly what you see in a live report specific to your organization's unique data.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the queries and populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to:

* Be assigned the role of **Insights Analyst** in Viva Insights.
* Have the June 2022 (or newer) version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/getting-started-with-power-bi/) to download and install the latest version.

## Report setup

### Run query

>[!Note]
> For this release of Viva Insights, this report is currently only available in English and will only work with data generated from the English version of Viva Insights.

1. In the Viva Insights analyst experience, select **Analysis**.

2. Under **Power BI templates**, navigate to **Ways of working** and select **Start analysis**. To get more information about the Ways of working template before running your analysis, select **Learn more**.

3. Under **Query setup**:
    1. Type a **Query name**.
    1. Select a **Time period**. **Time period** defaults to **Last 3 months**.
    1. Optional: You can set the query to automatically update by checking the **Auto-refresh** box. When you select the **Auto-refresh** option, your query automatically runs and computes a new result every time Viva Insights gets updated collaboration data for licensed people.

    >[!Note]
    >If the organizational data used in an auto-refreshing query changes (for example, an attribute name is altered or an attribute is removed), you might see an error when you run the query.

    4. Optional: Type a **Description**.
    
        Selecting **More settings** brings you to a pane, but there’s nothing you need to change there. In this pane:

        * Power BI queries are set to **Group by Week**. You can't edit this field.
        * The **Metric rules** field defaults to **Meeting exclusions rule (preferred rule)**. This field isn’t customizable in this release; for more information, refer to [Metric rules](../metric-rules.md).

    > Metrics in Power BI templates can't be edited in this release of Viva Insights. To expand the full list of metrics included in the Power BI template, select the arrow in the box beneath **Metrics, filters, and organizational attributes**.

5. You can filter the employees in scope for the report under **Select which employees you want to include in the query**. Don’t remove the predefined “Is Active” filter. For more details about filter and metric options, see [Create a Custom Person query](../person-query.md).

    ![Screenshot that shows the Is active filter.](/viva/insights/advanced/images/pbi-templates-isactive-filter.png)

6. Under **Select which employee attributes you want to include in the query**, add up to seven organizational attributes. Once the query runs, you can use these attributes to group and filter the reports.

    >[!Important]
    >Some employee attributes are required to set up this Power BI template, which are preselected for you in the query. *Don't remove any preselected attributes.*
    >
    >If you see attributes marked in red and the query’s **Run** button disabled, it means that these required attributes are missing from your organizational data. Contact your admin to upload them.

7. Select **Run** on the upper right side of the screen, which can take a few minutes to complete.

8. When your query results are ready, go to the **Query results** page and select the **Power BI** icon to download the Power BI template and copy the query identifier. You'll need the query identifier later.

## Report settings

After the **Ways of working** report is set up and populated with Viva Insights data in Power BI, review information on the **Summary** page. Then, view and set the following parameters on the **Settings** page.

* **Select the time period for the report** – Select the time period for which you want to view data in the report.  
* **Select an attribute to group data by** – Select the primary group-by attribute shown in all the reports. You can change this attribute at any time and all report pages will show group values by the new attribute.
* **Select optional report filter** – To filter the measured employee population, you can filter by any selected organizational attribute, and then filter by any of the values for these attributes. If you use filters, the measured employees count will reflect a reduced number. Measured employees reflect the number of employees in the filtered population who were active during the specified time period. Active employees are those who’ve sent at least one email or Teams chat during a work week included in the current time period.
* **Exclusions** – Use the check boxes to:
    * Exclude employees who are likely non-knowledge workers (that is, those spending less than five hours per week in meetings, emails, and/or Teams calls and chats).
    * Exclude weeks that are likely holiday or paid-time-off weeks or weeks that individuals are on other types of leave.

After confirming the settings, check the number of measured employees to confirm this is the population you want to analyze.
