# Power BI tips, FAQ, and troubleshooting

This article gives you a few guidelines to consider when setting up the Power BI templates, answers to some of the most frequently asked questions, and troubleshooting for the most common issues about setting up and using the templates in the the advanced insights app with Viva Insights.

## Setting up the Power BI template

These templates are designed to help Viva Insights users with the most common setups and business scenarios. For best results, use the following guidelines for selecting the parameters while setting up the templates for Power BI:

* Limit the number of employees included in your query results to 50,000 or fewer.
* Select the last six months or fewer for the time period.
* Include up to seven organizational attributes in your query, including the required ones.

You need to use Power BI Desktop to initialize the Viva Insights Power BI templates. When you open the Power BI template for the first time, and after you provide the query URL, Power BI will load the output of the queries. Depending on the parameters you selected when setting up the Viva Insights query, loading data into Power BI may take up to several hours. This applies to weekly data refresh as well.

If you follow the above guidelines, interacting with elements (like slicers) in the reports or navigating between pages should only take a few seconds.

After initializing the template, you might consider publishing it to the Power BI service to consume and share with others. For best results, publish the reports to a workspace in a **Premium** capacity. You can also [configure a scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh) in the Power BI service to define when you want to refresh the dataset.

## Sharing a report

Like other products that work with sensitive data, such as HR systems, advanced insights in Viva Insights are only available for certain users who should be trained to handle sensitive information. Refer to [Privacy](/viva/insights/advanced/privacy/privacy.md) when using data generated by Viva Insights.

Anyone you share the Power BI Desktop file with can access the underlying dataset at the same level of granularity as the analyst role. For this reason, consider the following alternatives that don't provide access to the underlying data:

* **Publish the report to Power BI Service and share insights in an app** – This option allows other users to navigate the report without access to the underlying data. Refer to [Distribute insights in an app for details](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports#distribute-insights-in-an-app) for more information.

* **Share as a PDF or other static file** – This option generates a report that's not interactive. Refer to [Export reports from Power BI to PDF](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-pdf) for more information.

## Customizing a template

Power BI templates are a great way to begin your journey with Viva Insights. After you get familiar with these templates, you can customize them to fit your organization’s needs. While you’re welcome to make changes, keep in mind that template customizations could affect report performance. Power BI reports that have been customized or modified are not supported by the Viva Insights team.

## FAQ

### Q1 Who can create the report in Power BI?

You need to be assigned the role of **Insights Analyst** in the advanced insights app to create the report. You also need to have the June 2022 version or newer of Power BI Desktop version installed. [Get Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).

### Q2 How do I share the report with others in my organization?

There are multiple ways to share Power BI reports. See [Ways to collaborate and share in Power BI](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports) to compare your options. You can share the report with others in your organization without sharing the underlying data by publishing the insights in an app or as PDF or static file.

### Q3 How frequently is data refreshed in the report?

If you selected the auto-refresh option for your Viva Insights query, your query automatically runs and computes a new result every time Viva Insights gets updated collaboration data for licensed people. 

However, the new results aren't automatically refreshed in Power BI. If you're working in Power BI Desktop, select **Refresh** on the **Home** ribbon to perform a one-time refresh. If you've published your report to the Power BI service, you can [configure a scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh) to define frequency and time slots to refresh your dataset.

>[!Important]
>You need to manually adjust the **Selected time frame** setting in the report's **Settings** page to view the most recently processed data. 

### Q4 Can I share the underlying report dataset with others in my organization?

To maintain data privacy, only employees assigned the role of **Insights Analyst** in the advanced insights app should have access to the underlying dataset in the Power BI report.

### Q5 How do I use Power BI?

See [Power BI documentation](/powerbi) for details on how to use Power BI.

### Q6 What languages are the dashboards available in?

For this release of Viva Insights, the reports are currently only available in English.

## Troubleshooting

### The import VivaInsight.Data matches no exports. Did you miss a module reference?

If you get the following error, you aren't using the June 2022 version of Power BI Desktop or newer.
