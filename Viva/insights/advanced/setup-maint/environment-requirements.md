# Environment requirements for Viva Insights

Environment requirements vary depending on the type of insights you view in Microsoft Viva Insights. They are personal insights, manager insights, or leader insights in Microsoft Teams or advanced insights in the web-based service.

## Personal insights

Microsoft Viva Insights provides personal insights in the [Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/viva-insights-app-in-teams-and-on-the-web-f07f80a1-177d-4541-9185-31493b74fc0f), [Briefing emails](../../personal/Briefing/be-overview.md), [Viva digest emails](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/digest-email-0e8b9a77-d1ce-4139-82bc-e91a3cb909c3), [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/about-the-viva-insights-outlook-add-in-48b73ccf-4086-4f13-9f62-dcee91a9df6d), and [inline suggestions](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/inline-suggestions-in-outlook-064a323e-6dc7-40e9-ab1b-199de8d39db5).

* Mozilla Firefox (latest version)

As an Outlook add-in, the Insights Outlook add-in requires a browser compatible with your system's platform and operating system. For details, see [Browsers used by Microsoft 365 add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins).

### Language support

### Prerequisite and exclusion

* **Prerequisite**: [Microsoft Exchange Online](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description) is required. 

  > [!Note]
  > Also refer to **Prerequisites to access the Viva Insights Outlook add in** in [About the Viva Insights Outlook add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/about-the-viva-insights-outlook-add-in-48b73ccf-4086-4f13-9f62-dcee91a9df6d).

* **Licensing exclusion**: Shared mailboxes are not supported.

## Manager, leader, and advanced insights

With the applicable [Viva Insights licensing](#viva-insights-licenses), your company can get manager and leader insights in Teams, and advanced insights features as an add-on to the licensing agreement.

Microsoft Exchange Online provides much of the collaboration data that Viva Insights uses. For this reason, we recommend you have a Microsoft 365 or an Office 365 product that contains Exchange Online Plan 1 and Plan 2.

## Channel support

Other channels such as Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) don't support the addition of Viva Insights at this time. Also, note the following circumstances for various types of customers:

|  Type  | Notes |  
|---- | ---- |
|Government | Government Community Cloud (GCC) supports personal insights only. |
|Education | Supported only for the analysis of faculty at this time, not for students. |
|Commercial | You can add Viva Insights with commercial enrollments. |
|Non-profit | Viva Insights can be used by non-profits but non-profit pricing isn't available. |
|First-line workers | Viva Insights doesn't support analysis of first-line workers that use Microsoft Firstline Worker SKUs (F1, F3, F5) at this time. |

## Tenant environments

Viva Insights requires the applicable [Viva Insights licensing](#viva-insights-licenses) and a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenant with Exchange Online Plan 1 or Plan 2.

## Viva Insights licenses

[Assign licenses](assign-licenses.md) to the users whose mailboxes you want to analyze. They include all the employees in your organization or a specific subset. To ensure statistical significance and meaningful comparative analysis, companies get the most benefit when they deploy Viva Insights to the entire company or to a large group of employees.

## Pricing

Contact your Microsoft account team for pricing. If you have questions about licensing, have your admin reach out to your Microsoft account team, or use [this form](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/buy-insights) to inquire about Viva Insights.

## Supported browsers

For the best experience, use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox are not preferred browsers for the advanced insights app available with Viva Insights. Internet Explorer is no longer a supported browser.
