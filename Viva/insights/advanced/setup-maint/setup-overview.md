# Viva Insights setup overview

Depending on the insights you want to see and which features they need, the setup process for Microsoft Viva Insights varies. This article gives a quick overview of the different types of insights available in Viva Insights and what you need to do to get things up and running.

## Personal insights

Your admin needs to set up Viva Insights for personal insights before you can start using the different personal insights apps that are available. For details, refer to the [Admin guide for personal insights](/viva/insights/personal/overview/mya-for-admins).

## Teamwork habits

**Teamwork habits** and its features are available to users with a Microsoft Viva Insights license with an applicable [service plan](/viva/insights/personal/overview/plans-environments).

You can access **Teamwork habits** through the Viva Insights app on the web or in Teams. To access through Teams, you'll need to set up the Viva Insights app in Teams. For details about setting up the app, refer to  [Install, pin, and configure the app](../../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md). For more information about Teamwork habits, refer to [Teamwork habits](../../org-team-insights/teamwork-habits.md).

## Organization trends

**Organization trends** offers more features to people who've been enabled as managers. Before you can start using Organization trends, your admin needs to:

* Enable you as a manager, which they can do through the **advanced insights app > [Manager settings](./manager-settings.md)**.

* Get the Viva Insights app set up in Teams so you can view insights there. For details, refer to  [Install, pin, and configure the app](../../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md). In addition to in Teams, you can also see the Viva Insights app on the web. For more information about Teamwork habits, refer to [Organization trends](../../org-team-insights/org-trends.md).

## Advanced insights

Before you can use Viva Insights' advanced analysis tools, your admin needs to complete the required steps in [Set up advanced insights](./setup.md). These steps include assigning licenses.
