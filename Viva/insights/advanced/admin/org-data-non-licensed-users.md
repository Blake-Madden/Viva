# Show organizational data for non-licensed users

When creating a meeting query, analysts can select meeting organizer attributes to appear in the query output. These attributes come from the organizational data youâ€™ve uploaded to Viva Insights. By default, Viva Insights does not show organizational data for non-licensed meeting organizers in meeting queries, but you can choose to do so.

### How to show organizational data for non-licensed users 

1. Go to the Privacy settings page in the advanced insights app. 
2. Check the box under Show organizational data for non-licensed users.
3. Select Save changes.

 

Important 

Show organizational data for non-licensed users only applies to queries that analysts run in the future. When you change this setting, it won't apply to queries that analysts have already run. 

 

How it works 

If you choose to show organizational data for non-licensed users, meeting query results will show meeting organizer attributes for non-licensed users if their data was included in the organizational data upload. In the following table, the meeting in the second row was organized by a user whose data was included in the organizational data upload but does not have a Viva Insights license.
