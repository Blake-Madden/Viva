# Delegate access to organizational insights 
As a group manager, you can delegate access to your organization insights to other people within your company.

By doing so, someone else at your company, such as your chief of staff or one of your direct reports, would have the same access you do to organization insights. They can view them and operationalize business decisions based on the data and insights.

There are no changes to the metrics, aggregation, or filtering tools available to the delegate. However, the delegate does not have access to your personal insights or personal recommended actions, like sharing insights or sending praise to a recent collaborator. 

If you use this optional feature, here are a few other things to note:

* You can only delegate access to people who have a Viva Insights license. 
* You can delegate access to whomever you want and to as many people as you want (maximum limit of 75), so long as they are in your tenant
* You can revoke access to whomever you want at any time
* A delegate cannot delegate access to others
* If you assign delegates, and you’re removed as a group manager from Viva Insights, the delegates you assigned are also removed along with their access.

### View delegated access to organization insights 
Applies to: People given delegate access by group managers
1. If you are given delegate access to organization insights, you receive an   automated message in Teams from the manager who gave you access.
2.	On the message, select **View insights.** You are then redirected to the manager’s view of organization insights.

3.	On the top left of the organization insights view, you can see a banner that says, **View insights for.** This banner lets you know which leader’s insights you’re viewing. If you are given delegate access by multiple leaders, select the banner to switch between insights for those leaders and your own.
