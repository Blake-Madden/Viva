# Digest email pause

At the end of March 2024, we’ll be pausing all types of digest emails, including individual contributor, manager, and welcome emails, which are typically sent twice a month. All the content from digest emails will still be available within the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web￼. You can continue to explore and analyze your data insights seamlessly. Here are some existing scenarios and where to find the features: 

Explore your habits & take a deeper look: These insights are spread across the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web.  
 
Your top collaborators: Go to the Teamwork tab within the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web to find your key collaborators. Learn who you work closely with and foster better working relationships by reading more about Teamwork in Viva Insights.
 
Meeting habits: In the Meetings tab, you’ll find details about your meeting habits. Optimize your productivity and understand how you spend your time in meetings. 
 
Connection: Go to the Teamwork tab to see your communication patterns. Explore how you connect with colleagues through email, chats, and calls. From here, you can view the percentage of time you spend on different tasks, view your network, and more within the Teamwork tab.
