# Digest email pause

At the end of March 2024, we’ll be pausing all types of digest emails, including individual contributor, manager, and welcome emails, which are typically sent twice a month. All the content from digest emails will still be available within the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web. You can continue to explore and analyze your data insights seamlessly. Here are some existing scenarios and where to find the features: 

**Explore your habits & take a deeper look:** These insights are spread across the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web.
