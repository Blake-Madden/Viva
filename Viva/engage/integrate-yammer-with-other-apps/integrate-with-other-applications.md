# Integrate Yammer with other applications

Yammer offers a variety of integrations to help make other applications more mobile and social. 
  
> [!TIP]
> For many integrations, it is helpful to know [how to find a Yammer community or group's feedID](https://support.office.com/article/392aea9c-e622-4f5a-8f6a-26dafe970bcb). 
  
## Yammer for SharePoint

Add Yammer feeds to your SharePoint pages. For instructions, see [Use a Yammer web part in SharePoint Online](https://support.office.com/article/a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da) and [Include a Yammer feed in a SharePoint page](embed-a-feed-into-a-sharepoint-site.md).

## Yammer and Skype for Business

You can [Add a Yammer feed to a Skype Meeting Broadcast](https://support.office.com/article/0d92d1c4-4032-4b5b-bee4-cdeab1aea7c0), or use Skype for business from within Yammer.

## Yammer Embed

 [Yammer Embed](/rest/api/yammer/embed-feed) delivers Yammer feeds to existing business applications, such as Skype for Business, the company intranet, CRM tools, or content management systems. 

## Yammer Connect

The [Yammer connector](/connectors/yammer/) is a host of social plug‐ins that gives you the flexibility to extend Yammer's social functionality across enterprise applications. 
  
## Yammer and Flow

[Microsoft Flow](/flow/) can be used with Yammer.  

- For a list of Flow templates for connecting Flow and Yammer, see [Flow Yammer templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_yammer/yammer/). Examples include using an RSS feed to send news to a Yammer group, posting to Yammer if new tweets match with a hashtag, posting to SharePoint when a message is posted in a group, posting to Yammer for a selected item or when a new item is posted in SharePoint, sending email when a new message is posted, and posting to Yammer from Facebook and Twitter.

- For other examples using Flow, see:

## Yammer for Salesforce.com

The Yammer for Salesforce.com Integration automatically delivers your Salesforce CRM activity to Yammer in real‐time. You can track the progress of Salesforce objects like accounts, opportunities, leads, and campaigns within Yammer and instantly collaborate with coworkers from any department. For more information, see [Yammer and Salesforce.com Integration Sample Code Solution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525982).
  
## Custom apps using the Yammer APIs

You can create your own applications using the data in Yammer, including creating tools to automate backing up data and deactivating users as they leave your company. The Yammer REST API provides an HTTP interface to features available in the Yammer Web Application, and the export API provides a way to export Yammer data.
