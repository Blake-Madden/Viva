# Viva Engage update on Internet Explorer 11 retirement

As of August 2021, Viva Engage, along with other Microsoft 365 apps and services, retired support for Internet Explorer 11. With the advances in web technology over the years, Internet Explorer 11 no longer provides the best experience to our customers.

We recommend transitioning to the latest Microsoft Edge to take advantage of all that Viva Engage and Microsoft 365 apps and services have to offer. Internet Explorer 11 continues to be supported by Microsoft as part of the OS lifecycle policy.

## What to expect from Viva Engage?

Leading up to August 2021, we will provide multiple in-product messages to help users transition over to a new modern browser. In August 2021, users will no longer be able to access Viva Engage and all its integrations from Internet Explorer 11.

For customers using the embedded Viva Engage experience (Viva Engage Embed) on custom-built sites, we are working on updating Embed with the new Viva Engage experience, but this will only be available on Internet Explorer leading up to August 2021. To get the new Viva Engage Embed experience in August 2021, you will need to access the site from Microsoft Edge or another modern browser.

Additionally, integrations that use Viva Engage APIs are best experienced in supported browsers. 

## How to prepare?

We recommend that you communicate with your users about this change. If you have not already deployed Edge or allow users to access other modern browsers, we recommend that you do so. For technical documentation, see [Plan your deployment of Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/deploy-edge-plan-deployment).

If youâ€™re looking for help on how to plan, deploy, or adopt Microsoft Edge, Microsoft offers the [FastTrack program](/fasttrack/win-10-microsoft-edge-assistance-offered) for customers with 150 or more paid seats of Windows 10 Enterprise. To get started, submit a [Request for Assistance with FastTrack](/fasttrack/win-10-microsoft-edge-assistance-offered).
