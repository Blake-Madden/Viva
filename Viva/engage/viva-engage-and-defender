# Viva Engage and Microsoft Defender 

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is a comprehensive software as a service (SaaS) solution that brings enhanced threat protection to Microsoft cloud apps.  When your admin enables Defender in your Microsoft 365 network, all user-generated navigation funnels through the Defender service to prevent encounters with potential threats and provide visibility into cloud app usage.

Defender works with Viva Engage the way you’d expect it to work with other cloud apps. Selecting a link in the Viva Engage app or in its system-generated email (such as a notifications or digests) safely routes you to your intended destination as soon as Defender verifies the link. 

If Defender can’t verify the link, it notifies you of the danger and routes you to safety. For more information, see What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps?
