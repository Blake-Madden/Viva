# New Yammer FAQ

Yammer has been completely redesigned, with dozens of new capabilities that power leadership engagement, company-wide communication, and communities. New Yammer delivers a beautiful, intelligent experience across devices and deep integration with Microsoft Teams and Outlook. As part of Microsoft 365, people can connect and share knowledge across the organization with open conversations backed by enterprise-grade privacy, security, and compliance.

As Microsoft’s first app built from the ground up with the Fluent Design System, new Yammer provides an engaging and easy-to-use experience on the web and in the Yammer apps for Android and iOS. In addition, Yammer can be integrated with Microsoft Teams, as a [Communities app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-yammer-communities-app-for-microsoft-teams-930c86f1-e1e2-4e45-a66a-ce8faca71a21) in the left rail and on mobile devices, enabling you to access organization-wide communities without leaving the hub for teamwork. [Integration with Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/work-with-yammer-from-outlook-fd695485-225b-410f-b24a-17f971b46b25) lets you read, like, and reply to Yammer conversations from within your Outlook inbox. Yammer also provides an updated integration experience in [SharePoint Online with the Conversations web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da).
 
Building on a decade of customer success and feedback, new Yammer delivers many top customer requests. A new, [personalized conversation feed](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/yammer-explained-how-the-feed-works/ba-p/2757489) powered by AI connects you with conversations across the organization.

Leaders can broadcast [live and on-demand events](https://support.microsoft.com/office/organize-a-live-event-in-new-yammer-7338782a-4f0b-4fd0-a6c3-33625906ead1) with a new, simpler production option using webcams and desktop sharing, and attendees can watch in Yammer, on mobile, or in the new Teams integrations.

## FAQs

**Q: How can I get new Yammer within my organization?**  

A: Yammer global administrators and verified network admins can configure access to new Yammer through the Yammer admin portal. From there, they can enable the toggle to display in the suite header or enable new Yammer across their network. For more information about managing opt-in settings, see [Bring new Yammer to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

**Q: Where can I find resources to help with deploying the new Yammer within my organization?**

A: The [Yammer Adoption Center](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/yammer/adoption/) includes materials to help you deploy new Yammer across your organization. This includes email templates for your internal announcement, Yammer tips and tricks, and a template for the new Community cover photos. There’s also a [Yammer end user guide](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8D13E85F1CF91770!254&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!ACrN15bnGCy_ZTs) to help your organization get up-to-speed quickly. 

**Q: Can we opt out of new Yammer at any time?**
A: Any users who have opted into the new Yammer experience will remain in that experience until they choose to go back to the classic experience. For more information about managing the available options, see [Bring new Yammer to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

**Q: Will links automatically redirect to the new or classic Yammer depending on my user setting?**

A: Yes.

**Q: Is the new experience available for customers that have a Yammer network with EU data residency?**

A: Yes!  
 
**Q: What about guest users in external groups?**

A: Users will either see the new Yammer or the classic Yammer experience depending on the state of their home network.

Any guest users within the external group will see the classic Yammer experience if their network is not yet enabled for the new experience.

A: Yes, our new Yammer web experience meets the industry’s accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0) which means that our core scenarios meet accessibility requirements. However, there are non-core scenarios where users may run into accessibility issues but these scenarios won’t hinder the full Yammer experience.

**Q: Are all languages supported in new Yammer?**

A: All languages available in classic Yammer are available in new Yammer.
