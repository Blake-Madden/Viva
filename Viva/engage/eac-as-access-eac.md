# Access the Viva Engage admin center

The admin center can only be accessed by users with the following admin roles: Global admin, Engage admin, Answers admin and corporate communicators. It cannot be accessed by end users (employees) within your organization.

Within the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the admin option. Select **Admin** to navigate to the Viva Engage admin center.

## Manage corporate communicators  

As a Global admin, Engage admin, and corporate communicator, you can identify and remove users as corporate communicators. Under the **Setup and configuration** tab, select **Manage corporate communicators** to open configuration options.

### Assign a user as a corporate communicator

Select **Add user** to search for a user by their name or email ID. Once the assignee is identified and selected as a corporate communicator, they will be visible in the list of active corporate communicators within your organization.

>[!NOTE]
> While assigning a user to this role is a pre-licensed capability, the actions this user can perform will depend on the nature of their license (core versus premium).  

Once assigned, the corporate communicator will be able to:

- **Create campaigns**
- **Manage campaigns** by:
    - Publishing Draft campaigns to be **Active** and viewable to all users in the network
    - Setting Active campaigns to **Ended** once a campaign is finished
    - Re-publishing Ended campaigns to be Active again for reoccurring campaigns
    - Deleting campaigns that are not relevant or were made by mistake
    - Updating certain assets on a campaign page such as the:
        - Goal tracker
        - Cover photo
        - Pinned posts
        - Pinned resources and links
        - Theme colors for the campaign hashtag
        - View campaign analytics

    - Identify leaders
        - Manage their audience

### Remove user as a corporate communicator

Selecting the delete icon on the right side of the corporate communicator list will remove the user from this role and they will no longer be visible as an active corporate communicator in your network.

## Configure tenant

As a Global admin or Engage admin, you are encouraged to set up your Viva Engage enterprise experience for all employees before they start using the application. This will help maintain a consistent experience. An Engage admin can navigate to the **Setup and configuration** tab within the Viva Engage admin center and select **Configure tenant**.

They are then routed to the Yammer admin center to perform the following actions:  

- [Configure the network](/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/configure-yammer)
    - Set tenant network name
    - Require users to confirm email messages before posting
    - Restrict who can upload files and limit file formats
    - Allow Tenor GIFs in messages
    - Control how links are displayed
    - Allow message translation
    - Set default system message language and many more
- [Customize the look](/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/customize-the-look-of-yammer)
- Manage domains in Office 365  
- [Migrate network to Native Mode](/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide) (if not done already)

>[!NOTE]
> Since Viva Engage is powered by Yammer’s technology, configuring the tenant through the Yammer admin center will publish changes to both Yammer and Viva Engage. We are working to actively bring these configuration options to the Viva Engage admin center as part of our admin roadmap.
