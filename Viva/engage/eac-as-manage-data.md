# Manage data in the Viva Engage admin center

## Manage Data
As an Office 365 (Global) admin or Engage admin, you are encouraged to use Yammer administrative tools to protect your Viva Engage data and comply with evolving legal and regulatory standards, including GDPR. An Engage admin can navigate to the **Governance and compliance** tab within the [Viva Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac) and select **Data**.

They are then routed to the Yammer admin center to perform the following actions:

- [Manage GDPR data subject requests](/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/gdpr-requests-in-yammer-enterprise)
    - Erase a user from the network
    - Reactivate a deactivated account after erasing the user

>[!NOTE]
> Since Viva Engage is powered by Yammer’s technology, removing a user from the network will delete the user in Yammer and Viva Engage.

- [Export data to review compliance issues](/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data)
    - Export data for one user
    - Export data for network
    - Export users and admin list

>[!NOTE]
> Since Viva Engage is powered by Yammer’s technology, any data generated as part of Viva Engage or Answers in Viva feature will be included in the existing Yammer exports.
