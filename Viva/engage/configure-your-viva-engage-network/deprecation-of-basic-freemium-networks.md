# Basic/Freemium are retired - Frequently asked questions

Starting December 1st, 2022, we retired Microsoft Yammer Basic/Freemium networks to ensure smoother integration and new functionality for our Microsoft Viva Engage customers. This decision was initially announced in June 2022, and loss of network access was enforced in May 2023.

**Q. We still want an Engage network. What can we do?**

**A.**  If your organization has an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 license, Engage is included. See [Manage Viva Engage domains in Office 365](viva/engage/configure-your-viva-engage-network/manage-viva-engage-domains).

If your organization doesn't have a license, [subscriptions are available](
https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=1) starting at $8 per user per month.

**Q. My organization has an Engage network, but users from Freemium networks collaborate with us. Can they join our network as guests?**

**A.**  Not unless they upgrade their license too. If you're based in the US, you can invite them to collaborate with you through an [external network](../work-with-external-users/create-and-manage-an-external-network.md).

**Q. What if we want to keep all our data from the old network and move it to the new network?**

**A.**  Data migration isn't a service provided by Microsoft. You can [engage a partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=862345&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=US) for data migration service from your basic network to your new enterprise network.

**Q. We're a nonprofit organization that relies on a free version. What can we do?**

**A.**  Microsoft offers special pricing for legally registered nonprofit organizations around the world. Learn more about [eligibility](https://www.microsoft.com/nonprofits/eligibility?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr4).

**Q. What if we just want to export our data from the basic network?**

**A.**  Contact support. They can give you temporary administrator access to your basic network so that you can perform a full export of the network data.
