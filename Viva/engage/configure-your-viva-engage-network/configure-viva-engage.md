# Configure your Viva Engage network

Complete these basic network configuration tasks in the Viva Engage admin center before you invite users to use Viva Engage Enterprise so that all users get a consistent experience.
  
As you're getting started with Viva Engage, review the links in [Viva Engage admin help](../eac-overview.md) for other tasks you might want to do, such as [reviewing security and compliance settings](../manage-security-and-compliance/security-and-compliance.md).
  
To access the Viva Engage network configuration tools:
  
- In Microsoft 365 or Office 365, go to **Admin** \> **Viva Engage** \> **Configuration**.

- Or, in Viva Engage, select the Viva Engage settings icon and go to **Network Admin** \> **Configuration**.

## Set the Viva Engage network name

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Viva Engage networks, the name in the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 company profile overrides the **Network name** setting in Viva Engage. To change the company profile settings, see [Change your organization's address, technical contact, and more](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more)

- On the **Configuration** page, in the **Basics** section, specify the following:

  - **Network name:** This is the friendly name of your network that is used in the Viva Engage header. This name is overwritten by the name used in the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 company profile.

  - **Message prompt:** This prompt is visible at the top of each Viva Engage group page, under **Update**.

## Review domains set up to work with your Viva Engage network

- On the **Configuration** page, in the **Network Domains** section, select **Click here** to verify that the correct domains are listed. These are the domains that have been set up in Office 365. For more information, see [Add a domain to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/17f4aa9b-5ece-4af8-8be4-a5e8ff8367f2).

## Require users to confirm email messages posted through email before posting

- On the **Configuration** page, in the **Email Settings** section, select whether to require users to confirm messages posted using email before posting.

    For more information about email and Viva Engage, see [Configure email and Viva Engage](configure-email-and-viva-engage.md).

## Restrict who can upload files and limit file formats

1. On the **Configuration** page, in the **File Upload Permissions** section, set which types of files can be uploaded.

2. To allow unlimited file types, select **Allow people to upload and attach files in any format**.

    Any number of files, images, or both can be attached to any message or reply, with each file size limited to 5 GB. By default, file attachments are enabled.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Uploading an image wider than 7680 pixels or taller than 4320 pixels will result in an error.
  
3. To restrict who can upload files, clear the **Allow people to upload and attach files in any format** checkbox. You'll then see three options:

      - **Allow people to upload and attach files in any format**

      - **Only allow people to upload and attach image or video files**: Limits attachments to images and videos. Viva Engage determines file type by extension.

         Viva Engage uses Azure Media Services to make videos viewable within the network. For more information, see [Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/media-services/).

      - **Don't allow anyone to upload or attach files**: This prevents people from uploading and attaching new files; however, existing attachments aren't be affected.

> [!NOTE]
> When files are stored in Viva Engage, there is no virus check. An admin can export the files and perform an offline virus scan on them, and this process can be automated with custom scripting.
>
> For Microsoft 365 connected Viva Engage groups that store files in SharePoint, virus checking is done as the file is uploaded. For more information, see [Virus dectection in SharePoint Online](/office365/securitycompliance/virus-detection-in-spo).

> [!TIP]
> Any admin can delete any file, and group admins can delete files posted to the groups that they manage.
>
> To delete files, a network admin can click the Viva Engage **Settings** icon and then click **Files**. This brings up the **Files** directory for the entire network. Group admins can delete files posted to a group by going to the **Files** tab within the group they administer.
  
## Enable or restrict the use of third-party apps

The growing network of partners and developers in Viva Engage continue to build third-party applications using an API. To find the list of current apps, including integrations with Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Flow, Microsoft Dynamics, and many more business applications, go to the [App Directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524143).
  
- On the **Configuration** page, in the **Enabled Features** section, specify whether to allow third-party applications.

 > [!CAUTION]
 > Clearing this setting prevents users from adding or accessing these applications. Note that all users, including verified admins, will lose access to apps that were added prior to clearing this setting.

 > [!NOTE]
 > This setting does not apply to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 connectors that can be added to Microsoft 365 groups. To disable use of these connectors in Viva Engage, use the following PowerShell command:  
 >```Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabledforYammer:$false```
 > 
 > For more information, see [Manage Microsoft 365 Groups with PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/manage-office-365-groups-with-powershell).

## Allow Tenor GIFs in messages

By default, users can attach GIFs provided by Tenor, a third-party, to posts.

> [!NOTE]
> The GIF search in Viva Engage defaults to Tenor's "young audience" and "strict" filters to keep GIFs appropriate in a school or work setting. If you see inappropriate GIFs in a search, send email to support@tenor.com with a link to the GIF.

You can turn off this feature so that users don't see GIFs from Tenor.

- From the **Configuration** page, in the **Enabled Features** section, turn off **Show Tenor GIFs Search**.

## Control how links are displayed

By default, when creating a message with a URL, Viva Engage will fetch content associated with third-party websites, including title, summary, images, and GIFs. Existing URLs that are cached remain until the cache expires.

You can turn off the display of this data for links.

- On the **Configuration** page, in the **Enabled Features** section, enable or disable **Fetch URL Content**.

## Allow users to view an org chart in Viva Engage

The org chart was retired for Office 365 Viva Engage networks in May 2018. Office charts are available at Skype for Business and Delve. For more information, see [Find info from a contact card in Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-info-from-a-contact-card-in-Skype-for-Business-d797905c-66f0-4248-b473-c49e3c9a0767) and [How can I find people and information in Office Delve?](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-can-I-find-people-and-information-in-Office-Delve-5b8bffdd-a50a-430a-8570-09b39481887c)
  
## Allow message translation

This feature gives users the option to translate messages from [any language supported by Microsoft Translator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/languages.aspx) into the network's default language. To enable this feature, the network admin must accept a Terms and Services agreement in order to use Microsoft's proprietary translation technology. This feature is disabled by default.

When this is enabled, users will see a **Translate** option right under any message that has been posted in a language different than the language they've selected in **Preferences** in their Viva Engage settings.
  
- On the **Configuration** page, in the **Enabled Features** section, select whether to allow **Message Translation**.

## Set language for system messages

System messages notify users of important actions in the network and conversations, such as creating a new group or adding people to a conversation. Changing the language will display future system messages in the selected language. Prior system messages will remain in the existing language.

- On the **Configuration** page, under **Set System Language**, choose the language to use.

## Set Require Admin Approval for external network invitations

Require Admin Approval setting allows network admins to review and allow or deny members of your home network from participating in external networks hosted by other organizations. Turn this setting **ON** to review and select whether or not members of your home network can participate in external networks hosted by other organizations.

When this setting is **ON**, and members from your home network are invited to participate in external networks hosted by other organizations, they can request your approval. You can review pending requests under the **Pending Requests** options in the **Edit** settings in your home network.

To turn this setting **ON**, go to **Network** settings and select **External Networks** and select the â€œRequire admin approval for members to join other companies' external groups or external networks" to **ON**.
