# Customize your Yammer community

In the new Yammer experience, you can brand your community with cover photos. Cover photos will help create a richer identity and better reflect the purpose of your community.

This customization experience is available for group admins in both the web and mobile apps. On the community page, users can see the new cover photos in the header. As a group admin (or a verified network admin), you can upload a cover photo for your group.

## To upload a web cover photo

1. In the community header, select **Upload Cover Photo**.
2. From the file list, select an image to upload.

   The file must be 20 MBs or less and is either a .png, .jpeg, or a non-animated .gif.
   The web cover photo dimensions are 680 px by 275 px.
