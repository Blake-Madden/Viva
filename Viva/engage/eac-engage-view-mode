# View-only mode in Viva Engage

When a user is in view-only mode, an information banner appears at the top of the Viva Engage experience. Publisher and creation features are disabled for the user. 
Users can follow others, report conversations, view analytics, receive and manage notifications, and bookmark threads while in view-only mode. 

## User experience in view-only mode

Users can also consume any announcements or important communications through Engage as well as visit any Engage surface to browse content. 

### What a user cannot do while in view-only mode

Edit existing posts, comments or replies in Viva Engage across all surfaces

Managing users in view-only mode
