Users assigned to view-only mode can continue to follow others, receive and manage notifications, view analytics, report conversations, and bookmark threads. Users can also view announcements and browse content in any Viva Engage app (desktop, web, mobile, Teams, Outlook or SharePoint).

## Limitations of view-only mode

The following features are no longer available to users in view-only mode.

- New post creation, commenting or replying to posts anywhere in Viva Engage

- Edit existing posts, comments or replies in Viva Engage across all surfaces

- Share content between communities or storylines (public or private)

## Manage users in view-only mode

Microsoft 365 Global admins and admins control View-only mode from the Engage admin center. [[How does it work? => "This control works by assigning specific users to view-only status. Once assigned, a user remains in view-only mode until changed at the admin's discretion. Engage admins can add or remove a userâ€™s view-only mode status at any time."]]

To control view only mode:
