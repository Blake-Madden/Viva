# Generate question/answer pairs in Viva Engage by importing documents

The Answers Intelligent Importer allows community admins to upload documents for AI to generate question-and-answer pairs, transforming static information into dynamic, interactive conversations. After content is generated and posted within Answers or Communities, it follows the same rules of visibility as other content on those surfaces. The generated answers are easily retrievable and reusable, preventing them from getting lost within the depths of a document.

>[!NOTE]
>This premium feature is currently only available for communities, but will soon be accessible on the Answers page for Engage admins. Viva Engage premium is included with a _Viva Suite_ or _Employee Communities and Communications_ license.  

## Enable the Answers Intelligent Importer in the Engage admin center

Engage admins control availablility of this feature on in their Viva Engage network.

The Answers Intelligent Importer settings are turned on, by default.

1. Go to the Engage admin center.
1. Select Features and Settings > Answers 
1. Under Intelligent Importer availability, turn on **Premium Communities**.

When this setting is enabled, community admins with access to premium functionalities on Engage can access and use the Intelligent Importer feature from within their specific communities.  

## Files suitable for importing

Each import action can generate 20 (maximum) question-and-answer pairs. For best results, import documents with these characteristics:

- File size 5 MB (max)

- Word documents (.docx), PDFs, and .txt files stored on the user’s local device

- 2 to 10 pages in length. Smaller documents provide better results.

>[!NOTE]
>Embedded images without text metadata aren't processed. 


## Import FAQs and other documents to your community

Community admins can import PDF, DOC, or TXT files (up to 5 MB) from their devices to populate communities with useful information. The Answers Intelligent Importer uses AI to extract question/answer pairs from the document.

1. In your community, select the Answers Intelligent Importer access point.
1. Follow the prompt to select and upload the file from your device. 
If the import was successful, Answers Intelligent Importer generates question and answer pairs from the content to the community landing page.
1. In the generated pairs, make edits and deletions as needed to the content. You can also improve future results by providing feedback (select thumbs up and thumbs down icons).
1. Select the pairs you want to import (up to 20) to your Engage community and select **Post**.
If the post is successful, it returns a confirmation message. 
Content posted through this feature follow the same rules of visibility as other knowledge content posted within that community.
