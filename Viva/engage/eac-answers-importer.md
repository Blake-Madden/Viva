# Generate questions and answers in Viva Engage by importing documents 

Community admins can generate question-and-answer pairs by uploading FAQs and other informational documents in Viva Engage. The Answers Intelligent Importer uses AI to transform your static documents into dynamic interactive conversations, ensuring that your organization's valuable content is easy to retrieve and reuse. Generated answers follow the same rules as other content: they're visible to anyone in your organization who has a Viva Suite license, unless you posted them to a private community.

>[!NOTE]
>Currently this premium feature is only available for communities, but will soon be accessible to Engage admins on the Answers page. Viva Engage premium is included with a _Viva Suite_ or _Employee Communities and Communications_ license.

## Enable the Answers Intelligent Importer

Engage admins can control the Answers Intelligent Importer in their Viva Engage network through these steps. The importer is on by default.

1. Go to [Viva Engage admin center on the web](http://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/admin), and from the gear icon at the top navigation menu, select **Admin center**.
1. On the **Feature management** tab, select the **Answers** button  to open the Answers configuration options.
1. Under **Intelligent Importer availability**, turn on **Premium Communities**.

When this setting is enabled, community admins with access to premium functionalities on Engage can access and use the Intelligent Importer feature in their communities.  

## File requirements 

To import a document, it must meet these requirements:

- .docx, .pdf, or .txt format
- 5 MB maximum file size
- 2-10 pages (smaller documents provide better results)
- Files must be stored locally
- Each file can generate a maximum of 20 question-and-answer pairs. If your document contains more than 20 questions, break it up into smaller files.

>[!NOTE]
>Embedded images with no textual metadata will not be processed.


## Import documents to communities

Community admins can populate their communities with useful information by importing informational documents.

1. Go to your community landing page, and select the Answers Intelligent Importer access point.
1. When prompted, select and upload a file from your device.

If the import was successful, Answers Intelligent Importer generates a list of question-and-answer pairs from the content.

1. Edits or delete items in the list, as needed. You can improve future import results by using the thumbs up and thumbs down icons to provide feedback.

1. Select the pairs you want to import (up to 20) and select **Post**.
If the post is successful, it returns a confirmation message and the question-and-answer pairs appear on the community landing page. 
Content posted through this feature follows the same rules of visibility as other knowledge content posted within that community.
