# Generate question-and-answer pairs in Viva Engage

Community admins can generate question-and-answer pairs by uploading FAQs and other documents in Viva Engage. The Answers Intelligent Importer uses AI to transform your static documents into dynamic interactive conversations, ensuring that your organization's valuable content is easy to retrieve and reuse. Generated answers follow the same rules as other content: they're visible to anyone in your organization who has a Viva Suite license, unless you posted them to a private community.

>[!NOTE]
>Currently this premium feature is only available for communities, but will soon be accessible to Engage admins on the Answers page. Viva Engage premium is included with a _Viva Suite_ or _Employee Communities and Communications_ license.

## Enable the Answers Intelligent Importer in the Engage admin center

Engage admins control the availablility of this feature in their Viva Engage network. By default, the Answers Intelligent Importer settings are turned on.

1. Go to [Viva Engage admin center on the web](http://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/admin), and from the gear icon at the top navigation menu, select **Admin center**.
1. On the **Feature management** tab, select the **Answers** button  to open the Answers configuration options.
1. Under **Intelligent Importer availability**, turn on **Premium Communities**.

When this setting is enabled, community admins with access to premium functionalities on Engage can access and use the Intelligent Importer feature in their communities.  

## Files suitable for importing

Each file can generate up to 20 question-and-answer pairs. For best results, import documents with these characteristics:

- .docx, .pdf, and .txt files stored on a local device
- 5MB maximum file size
- 2-10 pages in length (smaller documents provide better results)

>[!NOTE]
>The importer cannot process embedded images with no textual metadata.


## Import documents to communities

Community admins can populate their communities with useful information by letting AI extract question-and-answer pairs from informational documents.

1. Go to your community landing page, and select the Answers Intelligent Importer access point.
1. Follow the prompt to select and upload a file from your device.

If the import was successful, Answers Intelligent Importer generates a list of question-and-answer pairs from the content.

1. Make edits and deletions as needed. Improve future import results by providing feedback with the thumbs up and thumbs down icons.

1. Select the pairs you want to import (up to 20) and select **Post**.
If the post is successful, it returns a confirmation message and the question-and-answer pairs appear on the community landing page. 
Content posted through this feature follows the same rules of visibility as other knowledge content posted within that community.
