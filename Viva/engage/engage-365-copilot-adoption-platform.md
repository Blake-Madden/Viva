# Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption community in Viva Engage

Viva Engage network admins and corporate communicators can now enable a new type of community specifically built for employees to ask questions, seek support from peers and IT admins, share best practices, and learn how best to use Microsoft 365 Copilot.â€¯ 

Access to the Copilot community setup is through a banner in the home feed. This landing page is discoverable to network admins and corporate communicators in tenants with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses (specifically, Microsoft Copilot with Graph-grounded chat, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Productivity App, or Microsoft 365 Copilot in Microsoft Teams service plans).

>[!NOTE]
>The Copilot community is only available in Viva Engage premium. Both admins and users must have a Viva Suite or Communications and Communities license and a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.
