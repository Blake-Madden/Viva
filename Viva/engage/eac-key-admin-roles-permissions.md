# Key admin roles and permissions in Viva Engage

The following roles will have access to the Engage admin center within the Viva Engage app:  

- Microsoft 365 Global admin
- Engage admin  
- Answers admin  
- Corporate communicator

## Microsoft 365 Global admin

The Microsoft 365 Global admin has unlimited access to your organization’s settings and most of its data. Naturally, the Global admin has permissions to perform all configurations for Viva Engage in your organization. Navigate [here](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide) to learn more about this role and security guidelines for assigning it.

## Engage admin  

The Engage admin can set up and configure Engage for your organization and manage data, network related settings, and the various core or premium features within the application. The new role of Engage admin will be designated by [adding Yammer administrators in AAD](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/the-new-yammer-administrator-role-is-now-available-in-azure/ba-p/3592577). Yammer AAD administrators will automatically become Engage admins and they will have elevated permissions over end users. Tying the Engage admin to the Yammer administrator AAD role was intentional, since Viva Engage as an application is powered by Yammer technology.

>[!NOTE]
> This admin role can be assigned and modified by a Global admin through AAD, [PIM](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure), [group based role assignments](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-concept), or [Azure portal and PowerShell](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

**Permissions**

The table below shows the range of actions available to Engage admin and Global admin based on their license. Admin permissions will be dependent on the users having the right licensing to configure those features.

## Answers admin  

The Answers admin role can set up and configure Answers within the Viva Engage application. This role can only be assigned or modified by a Global admin and will be designated by [adding Knowledge Managers in AAD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Froles%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context). All Knowledge Managers will become Answers admins and they will have elevated permissions over end users. Tying the Answers admin to the Knowledge Manager AAD role was intentional, since Answers is best experienced when integrated with Topics.  

**Permissions**

## Corporate communicator

Corporate communicators have privileges such as creating and managing campaigns, defining leaders, and more in Viva Engage. This role was created to address the need for a role catered towards content management in the organization, beyond being attached to a community (Community admin) but not as powerful as the overall Engage admin. Corporate communicators can be assigned, modified, or deleted from users by the following admin roles: Global admin, Engage admin, and fellow corporate communicators.

**Permissions**

The table below shows the range of actions available to a corporate communicator, Engage (Yammer) admin, and Global admin based on their license.
