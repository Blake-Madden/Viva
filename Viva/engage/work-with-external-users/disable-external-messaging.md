# Disable external messaging in a Yammer network

By default for Yammer Enterprise networks in the US Geo, users can add external participants to their Yammer conversations and Yammer groups, and members of your Yammer network can participate in another company's Yammer network if invited. If needed, you can turn off this external collaboration.

1. In the Yammer admin center, go to **Content and Security** \> **Security Settings**.
    
2. In the **External Messaging** section, select the option that makes sense for your organization: 

     -  **Allow users in this network to participate in groups or conversations in other networks, and allow external users to participate in groups or conversations in this network.**    
   
     - **Allow users in this network to participate in groups or conversations in other networks, but don't allow external users to participate in groups or conversations in this network.**     
   
     - **Don't allow users in this network to participate in groups or conversations in other networks, and don't allow external users to participate in groups or conversations in this network.**

 ## What each option does

| Option | Users can participate in other networks <sup>1</sup> | External participants can participate in groups and conversations <sup>2</sup> |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------|
|**Allow users in this network to participate in groups or conversations in other networks, and allow external users to participate in groups or conversations in this network.**| Yes | Yes|
|**Allow users in this network to participate in groups or conversations in other networks, but don't allow external users to participate in groups or conversations in this network.** | Yes | No|
|**Don't allow users in this network to participate in groups or conversations in other networks, and don't allow external users to participate in groups or conversations in this network.**| No | No|

1. When you prevent users from being able to participate in other networks:

    - Users are blocked from receiving invitations from Yammer networks on other domains.

2. When you disable external access to your groups and conversations:

    - When a user tries to add an external participant in Yammer, the user receives an error message stating that they are unable to add external participants because it violates their company's policy. The user will not be allowed to post the message. 

    - Any current external participants are blocked from using external conversations or threads that they may have been participating in.

    - No new external groups can be created.
