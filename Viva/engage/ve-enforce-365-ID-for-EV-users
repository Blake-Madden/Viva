# Enforce Office 365 identity for Viva Engage users

As Viva Engage becomes a core service for your organization, you'll want users to be able to sign in seamlessly, 
just like any other Office 365 service. Additionally, you'll probably want to maintain a single identity for all Office 365 users
 for easier user management. You can achieve both of these goals by enforcing Office 365 identity in Viva Engage. 
 By enforcing Office 365 identity in Viva Engage and configuring [password hash sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization), [pass-through authentication](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-pta), or [Understanding Office 365 identity and Azure Active Directory](https://support.office.com/article/06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9#BK_Federated) for Office 365, admins can achieve single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for all services in Office 365, including Viva Engage. 
  
## How enforcing Office 365 identities in Viva Engage works

The following flowchart shows what happens when a user signs in to Viva Engage.

When Office 365 identity is not enforced for Viva Engage, the user can expect the following signin experience:
  
1. A user tries to sign in to Viva Engage, and is presented with a dialog box.
    
2. The user enters their email address.

3. When Office 365 identity is enforced, the user is prompted to sign in with the Office 365 identity that corresponds to their email address, or with single sign-on (if the federated identity model is implemented in Office 365).

4. When Office 365 identity is not enforced (the default setting):
  - the user is prompted to sign in with the Office 365 identity that corresponds to their email address, or
  - the user is prompted to sign in with their Viva Engage identity (email and password) if no Office 365 account corresponds to the user's email address.

The following table compares the user sign-in behavior when Office 365 Identity is enforced or not enforced. Office 365 identity is not enforced by default.

## Start enforcing Office 365 identity in Viva Engage

It takes just a few steps to start enforcing Office 365 identities in Viva Engage. However, turning on this setting can accidentally disrupt users' access to Viva Engage. So before you begin, do the following make sure that your Viva Engage users can continue working smoothly:
  
- **Make sure that all current Viva Engage users have a corresponding Office 365 identity.** When you enforce Office 365 identities for Viva Engage, any user without a corresponding Office 365 identity will be locked out of Viva Engage. So before you begin, make sure that all of your current Viva Engage users have corresponding Office 365 identities. One method to check this is to go to the **Export Users** page in Viva Engage and export all users. Then compare that list to the list of users in Office 365 and make any needed changes. 
    
- **Inform your users about this change.** We strongly recommend that you tell users you are switching to enforce Office 365 identities, because it can disrupt their day-to-day usage of Viva Engage. We have provided a sample email you can use in the settings below. 
    
You must be a global administrator on Office 365 who was synchronized to Viva Engage as a Verified Admin to perform these steps. To check if your account was synchronized, you can go to the **Network Admin** page on Viva Engage and check the **Admins** section. Global administrators will sync to Viva Engage only if their user principal name (UPN) in Office 365 matches a domain on Viva Engage. The following screenshot shows what a synced admin looks like on the Admins page in Viva Engage.

 If you are ready to enforce Office 365 identity in Viva Engage, follow the steps below. 
  
 **To start enforcing Office 365 identity in Viva Engage**
  
1. In Viva Engage, go to the **Network Admin** section, and choose **Security Settings**.
    
2. In the Security Settings page, go to the **Office 365 Identity Enforcement** section and select **Enforce Office 365 identity**. 
    
    You must be both a Viva Engage verified administrator and a global administrator to see this section. 

3. You see a confirmation message that asks you to select the most appropriate level of enforcement: 
    
   - **Committed Enforcement**:â€¯ Choose this option if all of your Viva Engage users already have an Azure Active Directory (AAD) account. 
    
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Once you save this change, you won't be able to undo it, and your users won't be able to sign in using their Viva Engage usernames and passwords anymore. 
  
   - **Temporary 7-Day Enforcement**: Choose this option if you're testing the enforcement of Office 365 identity on your network, and may need to revert it back. Once you save this change, a temporary enforcement period of seven days will begin, and your users won't be able to log in using their Viva Engage usernames and passwords anymore. After seven days, your network will automatically be committed to Office 365 Identity enforcement.

4. If you want, you can automatically sign out all current users, so that you can be sure that everyone using the Viva Engage service have signed in with their Office 365 identities. If you want to do log out all current users, select the **Log out all users** checkbox. If you choose to do this, we recommend that you communicate this change to your users by using the following sample email.
    
   *Subject Line: [Action Required] Sign in to Viva Engage* 
    
   *Hi,* 
    
   *This email is to let you know that [ORGANIZATION'S NAME] is making changes to the way we all access Viva Engage. If you're currently working on Viva Engage, then we may temporarily interrupt you by logging you out. It's necessary for us to securely set up Office 365 sign-in for Viva Engage.* 
    
   *You can resume your work immediately by signing in to Viva Engage using your Office 365 username and password.*
    
   *We've made this change so that you can access all of Office 365 with a single identity. If you're unable to sign in using your Office 365 username and password, let your network administrator know.* 
    
   *Thank You,* 
    
   *[SIGNATURE]* 
    
5. If you are ready to start enforcing this setting, select **Okay**. You will return to the Security Settings page where the **Enforce Office 365 identity in Viva Engage** checkbox is now selected. 
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also select [Start blocking users who don't have Yammer licenses](../manage-yammer-users/manage-yammer-licenses-in-office-365.md#StartBlocking) to ensure that only users with Viva Engage licenses can login to Viva Engage.

## FAQ
<a name="FAQ"> </a>

### Q: Once Office 365 Identity Enforcement is set to 'Committed Enforcement', why can't I revert it back?

A: Once your organization has committed to enforcing Office 365 identity and has one Office 365 tenant associated with a single Viva Engage network, connected groups will be enabled for this network.. In this configuration, whenever a group is created in Viva Engage, a connected Microsoft 365 group is also created, and users can take advantage of tools like SharePoint, Planner, and OneNote connected to the group. At this point, reverting the **Enforce Office 365 Identity** setting will be disruptive to the user experience, since users who log in with their user names and passwords cannot access these connected resources any more.
  
### Q: How will this change impact guest and external users?

A: Guests and external users will be unaffected. They can continue to follow the sign in settings and requirements of their home network. 
  
### Q: How long does it take for this setting to be applied?

A: Enforce Office 365 Identity is applied immediately after the setting is set.
  
### Q: We use the same ADFS configuration in Viva Engage and Office 365. Should we log users out during the transition?

A: Yes. Sign out ensures all users signed in after that are connected to their Office 365 identity. The Office 365 identity connects users for user lifecycle management from Office 365 and also provides a consistent experience for them, with things like Office 365 suite navigation.
  
### Q: What is the experience for users being logged-out when enforcing Office 365 identities?

A: Users will be signed out of their web and mobile sessions immediately and are required to sign in in all their devices and browser sessions again, this time using their Office 365 identity configuration and credentials.
  
### Q: How can I audit and clean up Viva Engage users when compared to Office 365 and Azure AD?

A: You can audit Viva Engage users in networks connected to Office 365 and take appropriate actions based on it. See more information and examples in [How to audit Viva Engage users in networks connected to Office 365](../manage-yammer-users/audit-users-connected-to-office-365.md).
