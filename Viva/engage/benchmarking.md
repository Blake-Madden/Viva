# Benchmarks in analytics

Benchmarking is a Viva Engage premium feature that shows organizations how their metrics are performing in comparison to other organizations and audiences that use Viva Engage. 

Benchmarking provides a percentile that corresponds to your current
_People Engaged_ metric within both Network and Audience analytics. For Audience analytics, this percentile tells you how engaged your audiences are compared to other audiences in your network. For Network analytics, your organization is compared to similar-sized organizations to determine engagement.

>[!NOTE]
>At least 50% of the network’s users must be licensed for *Viva Suite* or *Employee Communications and Communities* for the Network Analytics dashboard to be available.

## Benchmarking calculations

Network Analytics benchmarks your company against similarly-sized organizations. The size sectors are determined by the number of active users within the organization. This is displayed for Network Administrators and Corporate Communicators on the Network Analytics’ “Network Activity” card.
Audience Analytics uses peer benchmarking to rank the percentage of people engaged across all audiences in the same organization to produce the corresponding percentile. This percentile appears on the Audience Analytics’ “Audience Engagement” card for leaders, delegate managers, and delegates.

### Enable Benchmarking

Only Verified and Network admins can turn benchmarking features on and off.

1. From the Viva Engage admin control center, select Setup & Configuration > Analytics and AI.
1. To enable benchmarking within Network Analytics, go to Network Analytics and use the toggle to turn the Engagement Benchmarking option on.

1. To enable benchmarking within Audience Analytics, go to Audience Analytics and use the toggle to turn the Engagement Benchmarking option on or off.
