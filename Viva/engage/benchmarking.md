# Benchmarks in Viva Engage analytics (Private preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Viva Engage benchmarking data are currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change.

Benchmarking is a Viva Engage Premium feature that shows organizations how their metrics perform in comparison to other organizations and audiences that use Viva Engage. Only verified and network admins can enable benchmarking features in Viva Engage.

Benchmarking provides a percentile that corresponds to your current _People Engaged_ and _Audience Engage_ metrics. For **Network Analytics**, the benchmark percentile tells you how engagement in your organization compares to similar-sized networks. For **Audience Analytics**, the benchmark percentile tells you how engaged your audiences are compared to other audiences within your network.

## Benchmarking calculations

Network Analytics benchmarks your company against similarly-sized organizations. Size sectors are determined by the number of active users within the organization and are displayed on the Network Analytics’ **Network Activity** card for network administrators and corporate communicators.

Audience Analytics uses peer benchmarking to rank the percentage of people engaged across all audiences in the same organization to produce the corresponding percentile. This percentile appears on the Audience Analytics’ **Audience Engagement** card for leaders, delegate managers, and delegates.

## Enable Benchmarking

Verified and Network admins can turn benchmarking features on and off from the Viva Engage admin center.

1. Go to [Viva Engage admin center on the web](http://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/admin), and from the gear icon at the top navigation menu, select **Admin center**.

1. On the **Setup & Configuration** tab, select **Analytics and AI**.

1. To enable benchmarking for Network analytics, go to **Network Analytics** and use the toggle to turn the **Engagement Benchmarking** option on.
    When this toggle is enabled, you can see how your engagement compares to other networks that use Engage. Your network data may be included in our benchmarking calculations with data from other similar-sized organizations for the purpose of comparison only.

    >[!NOTE]
    > If less than 50% of the network’s users are licensed for *Viva Suite* or *Employee Communications and Communities* the Network Analytics dashboard will be unavailable.

1. To enable benchmarking for Audience analytics, go to **Audience Analytics** and use the toggle to turn the **Engagement Benchmarking** option on.
    When this toggle is enabled, you can see how your engagement compares to other leaders that use Engage in the same organization. Your audiences’ data may be included in our benchmarking calculations for the purpose of comparison only.
