# Benchmarks in Viva Engage analytics (Private preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Viva Engage benchmark data are currently available only for private preview customers. The features described here are subject to change.

Benchmarks is a Viva Engage Premium feature that shows you how your metrics perform in comparison to other customers that use Viva Engage. Only verified and network admins can enable benchmarks in Viva Engage.

## How we calculate benchmarks

Benchmarks provide percentiles that correspond to your current metrics.

For **Network Analytics**, this percentile uses the _People Engaged_ metric to tell you how engagement levels in your organization compare to similarly sized networks. Network size sectors are defined by the number of active users within an organization. Both network administrators and corporate communicators can access the Networks Analytics benchmark on the **Network Activity** card.

For **Audience Analytics**, this percentile uses the _Audience Engaged_ metric to tell you how your engagement levels compare to all audiences in the same organization. Leaders, delegate managers, and delegates can access the Audience Analytics benchmark on the **Audience Engagement** card.

## Enable benchmarks

Verified and Network admins can turn benchmarks on and off from the Viva Engage admin center.

1. Go to [Viva Engage admin center on the web](http://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/admin), and from the gear icon at the top navigation menu, select **Admin center**.

1. On the **Setup & Configuration** tab, select **Analytics and AI**.

1. To enable benchmarks for Network analytics, go to **Network Analytics** and use the toggle to turn on **Engagement Benchmarking**.
    When this toggle is enabled, you can see how your engagement compares to other networks that use Engage. Your network data may be included in our benchmark calculations with data from other similar-sized organizations for the purpose of comparison only.

    >[!NOTE]
    > If less than 50% of the network’s users are licensed for *Viva Suite* or *Employee Communications and Communities*, the Network Analytics dashboard will be unavailable.

1. To enable benchmarks for Audience analytics, go to **Audience Analytics** and use the toggle to turn on **Engagement Benchmarking**.
    When this toggle is enabled, you can see how your engagement compares to other leaders that use Engage in the same organization. Your audiences’ data may be included in benchmark calculations for the purpose of comparison only.
