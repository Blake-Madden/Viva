# Export data from Yammer Enterprise

As a verified admin, you can export Yammer Enterprise data to monitor usage and content and for discovery and compliance purposes. The following table lists the four ways to export data.
  

| Method <br/> | Purpose <br/> |
|:-----|:-----|
|[Export user and admin list](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md#ExportUsers) <br/> |Identify status of current admins and users, and review email, title, location, and department of each user.  <br/> |
|[Export Yammer network data by date range and network](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md#ExportNetworkData) <br/> |View and audit all network data for all users. You can specify a date range, and choose whether to include files and external network data.  <br/> |
|[Export data for one user](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md#ExportOneUser) <br/> |Identify all data related to one user. You can use this export to identify data that needs to be deleted to comply with a GDPR data subject request.  <br/> |
|[Set up automatic data exports](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md#Automatic) <br/> |Automate exports that need to be done on an ongoing basis for compliance by using the DataExport API.  <br/> |
|[Export Yammer Files via API](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md#export-yammer-files-via-api) <br/> |Export Files stored in Yammer asynchronously. You can specify a date range, and choose whether to include files from external networks. <br/> |
   
> [!NOTE]
> Exported data can't be used for migrating content between Yammer networks. For migration information, see [Network migration: Consolidate multiple Yammer networks](../configure-your-yammer-network/consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks.md).

## Export Yammer network data by date range and network

1. In the Yammer admin center, go to **Content and Security** \> **Export Network Data**.
    
2. Specify the data to include:
    
    ![Export page, showing export options.](../media/9961176e-dcb5-453c-82a1-ff9d986877ad.png)
  
      - **Date range:** Only data in the specified date range will be included. 
    
      - **Include attachments**: If not selected, you'll get a list of files. If selected, you also get a **Files** folder with all files in their native format. 
    
      - **Include external networks**: If not selected, you'll only get data from your home network. If selected, you'll get a separate folder for the data from each network. Each network is identified by its ID, and the full network names are listed in **Networks.csv**. 
    
    ![Each network has its own folder, labeled with the network ID.](../media/5b8e96a8-b8bf-4467-b6d2-6a0bb9175d3c.png)
  
3. Click **Export**.
    
    Data is exported into a .zip file. If there is more than one network exported, a separate folder is created for each network. 
   
	| File <br/> | Contents <br/> |
	|:-----|:-----|

	|**request.txt** <br/> |The parameters of the export.  <br/> |

Files that are stored in SharePoint are not exported. <br><br>The file_ID and path columns in Files.csv can be used to identify the files in the **Files** folder or to go directly to the file in Yammer. For information about how to go directly to a specific file, see [Delete specific messages or files](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md#DeleteMessagesFiles).  <br><br> For files that are stored in SharePoint, use the download_url column to download the file. If the SharePoint files don't have Azure AD tokens, then you can [follow these instructions to create an Azure AD app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2143320). Or, you can use [Content Search in Office 365](/office365/securitycompliance/content-search) to find files stored in SharePoint during the specified date range. <br><br>To delete a file, whether it is saved in Yammer or SharePoint, always delete it from  Yammer. This erases the metadata in Yammer as well as the metadata and file in SharePoint. If you delete the file from SharePoint directly, the Yammer metadata still remains.  <br/> |

## Troubleshoot data export

- If the .zip file is corrupted and can't be unzipped, try again. If this doesn't work, [contact Support](https://support.office.com/article/Contact-support-for-business-products-Admin-Help-32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).

- If the log.txt file shows export errors for one category of data, try again. If there are still errors, [contact Support](https://support.office.com/article/Contact-support-for-business-products-Admin-Help-32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).
 
<a name="DeleteMessagesFiles"> </a>
## Find and delete specific messages or files

Use the Yammer file ID from the export to go directly to the file in Yammer and delete it. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Yammer files stored in SharePoint, delete the files from Yammer in order to remove the Yammer metadata as well as the file.
  
To find and delete a specific message: 

1. Build the URL for the message. Use **https&#58;//www&#46;yammer&#46;com**/*network_name*/**#**/**Threads**/**show?threadId=** *thread_id*. For example, https&#58;//www&#46;yammer&#46;com/contosomkt&#46;onmicrosoft&#46;com/#/Threads/show?threadId=1040647232.

2. In the message, click the **More** icon ![More icon (...).](../media/d9378a9a-fb0a-4313-96e5-bc6c9f1d5827.png), and then click **Delete**.
    
To find and delete a specific file:

- Use the **Search** box in Yammer. For example, for a file named 12345678.pptx in the export, search for 1235678.pptx. In the search results, click **Go to File** file, and then click **Delete this File**.

- Or, build the URL for the file. Use **https&#58;//www&#46;yammer&#46;com**/*network_name*/**#**/**files**/*file_number*, for example https&#58;//www&#46;yammer&#46;com/contosomkt&#46;onmicrosoft&#46;com/#/files/12345678. On the Yammer page for the file, click **Delete this File**.

## Set up automatic data exports


To set up automatic recurring exports, use the Yammer API. For information about the Data Export API, go to [/export](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534735) on the Yammer Developer Center. 

<a name="ExportFiles"></a>
## Export Yammer Files via API
The Yammer Files Export API lets verified administrators archive and export files in Yammer storage in an asynchronous manner. This API is intended to be used when there is a significant volume of files to be exported from Yammer. For more information, please see [Yammer Files Export API](https://aka.ms/YammerFilesAPI).
