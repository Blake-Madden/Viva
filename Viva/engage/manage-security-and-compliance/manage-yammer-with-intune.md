# Manage Yammer with Microsoft Intune

When you subscribe to [Microsoft Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=817224), you can use mobile application management (MAM) with Yammer along with other apps. MAM allows you to manage and protect data in an app on a device even if it is not enrolled in mobile device management (MDM).
  
## Manage Yammer with MAM

Microsoft Intune provides mobile application management (MAM) capabilities for Yammer, Outlook, and other Office mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
  
This feature is especially helpful for organizations where devices and apps are used for both work and personal use and the device is not enrolled in MDM. When using Yammer with Intune, you can set up policies that apply to the Yammer app on Android and iOS devices to help protect your corporate data. For example, you can do the following:
  
|**Intune policy you can enforce on the app**|**Available for Android?**|**Available for iOS?**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Allow apps to transfer data to other apps.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |

|Allow use of fingerprint instead of PIN.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |
|Require corporate credentials for access.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |
|Block managed apps from running on jailbroken or rooted devices.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |
|The frequency of how often the access requirements are checked.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |
|Block screen capture and Android Assistant.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |
|When a device with the Yammer app is retired or un-enrolled, all of the application's corporate data will be deleted.  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |

> Intune MAM policies will be enforced when users authenticate to Yammer through Office 365 (Azure Active Directory) accounts and sign-in. They are not enforced when users authenticate to Yammer with Yammer-specific passwords or Yammer temporary passwords.
