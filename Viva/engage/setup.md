# Set up Viva Engage

## Set up licensing for Viva Engage

**Viva Engage Core experience**

If you don't enforce Viva Engage licensing in your organization, users can access the Viva Engage core experience.
<br>If you do enforce Viva Engage licensing in your tenant, each user must be assigned both:

- Microsoft 365 license, *and*

- Viva Engage Core Service Plan (or Yammer Enterprise Service Plan)

>[!NOTE]
>The Core Service plan is a foundational component of Microsoft Viva Engage and can provide essential features and capabilities to enhance employee engagement and collaboration within your organization.

**Viva Engage Premium experience**

Microsoft 365 Global administrator and Engage administrator roles can manage and configure premium experiences for the organization if the tenant purchased either of the following premium licenses:

- Microsoft Viva Suite
- Microsoft Viva Employee Communications and Communities

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Administrators don’t require a premium Viva Engage license to configure and set up premium Viva Engage and Answers experiences. Learn more about Viva Engage admin roles.
[Manage Viva Engage licenses in Microsoft 365](/Viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365).

## Configure and review privacy and security settings

The Engage administrator (Yammer administrator) can manage the content in Viva Engage.
For details, see [Overview of security & compliance for Viva Engage](/viva/engage/manage-security-and-compliance/security-and-compliance).

## Set up Viva Engage

Where you set up Viva Engage is a matter of preference. Global and Engage admins (Yammer administrators in Microsoft Entra ID) can use the Microsoft 365 admin center for initial setup. Alternatively, the Viva Engage admin center provides most settings and customization options. To control some Viva features, such as Copilot in Viva Engage, you must use feature access management.

From the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can:

- Assign Engage admins

- Pin Viva Engage in Teams

- Manage other settings in Viva Engage

## Install Viva Engage

### Install Viva Engage in Teams

The Microsoft Teams admin can deploy and pin the app for all users or for particular departments through a [Teams app setup policy](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies). By pinning the app, users can easily set up Viva Engage in Teams using the following steps:

1. Open Teams on the web or in a desktop client.

2. From the left side of Teams, select **Apps**.

3. Search for Viva Engage.

4. Select the Viva Engage app, and then select **Add**. The app is added to all your Teams clients, including mobile.

## Install or access Viva Engage from other surfaces

You can run Viva Engage on different surfaces. To give your users the greatest number of options, provide the following resources:

- [Install the Viva Engage desktop app](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/en-au/office/install-the-viva-engage-desktop-app-66ccb412-ca1d-4e43-872c-9705abf11b1b)

- [Access Viva Engage on the web](https://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/feed)

## Customize the appearance for Viva Engage in the Teams store

You can customize the appearance for the following properties of the Viva Engage app in the Teams app store:

- app name
- app description
- app icons
- accent color

Customizing the Viva Engage app is a good choice for companies that tailor their network branding to fit their corporate identity.

**Note:** Currently, customizations don't affect the Viva Engage app branding shown in the app _within_ the Viva Engage Experience. To learn more, see [Customize details of an app](/MicrosoftTeams/customize-apps#customize-details-of-an-app).
