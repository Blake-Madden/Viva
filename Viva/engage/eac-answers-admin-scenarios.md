# Administrator scenarios for Answers in Viva Engage

Enablement of Answers requires a Microsoft 365 Global administrator. The Answers admin or an Engage admin can perform all other Answers administration tasks.

>[!NOTE]
> To assign an Answers admin, you must [add a Knowledge Manager in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Froles%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context). Knowledge managers become Answers admins.

To align Topics management and Answers administration, assign the same users that manage Topics to manage Answers. For more information, see:
- [Assign a role to a group using Privileged Identity Management](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-pim-eligible)
- [Create a role-assignable group in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-create-eligible)
