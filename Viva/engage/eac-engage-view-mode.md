# View-only mode in Viva Engage (Private Preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Viva Engage view-only mode is currently available only for private preview customers.  The features described here are subject to change.

Microsoft 365 Global admins and Engage admin can use view-only mode to prevent a Viva Engage user from contributing content.

## User experience in view-only mode

In view-only mode, an information banner appears at the top of the Viva Engage experience, and publisher and creation features are unavailable. Users assigned to view-only mode can continue to follow others, receive and manage notifications, view analytics, report conversations, and bookmark threads. Users can also view announcements and browse content in any Viva Engage app (desktop, web, mobile, Teams, Outlook, or SharePoint).

## Limitations of view-only mode

When a user is in view-only mode, they have **no access** to the following features:

>[!NOTE]
>These limitations apply throughout the Viva Engage app and on all surfaces (desktop, web, mobile, Teams, Outlook, or SharePoint).

- Creation of new posts, comments or replies to posts

- Editing capability on existing posts, comments, or replies

- Content sharing between storylines or communities (public or private)

## Manage users in view-only mode

Admins can set view-only mode from the Engage admin center. This control works by assigning specific users to view-only mode. Once assigned, a user remains in view-only mode until removed at the admin's discretion. Engage admins can add or remove view-only mode for a user at any time.

To set view-only mode:

1. Go to the [Viva Engage admin center](/viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac).
1. Select the **Feature management tab**.
1. _[Step to add a user to view-only mode.]_
1. _[Step to remove a user from view-only mode.]_
