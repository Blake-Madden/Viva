# View and manage analytics in Viva Engage

Advanced analytic capabilities in Viva Engage help licensed users monitor their own engagement metrics (personal analytics), leaders monitor their audience’s engagement (audience analytics), manage social campaign engagement (campaign analytics), and monitor engagement in Answers (Answers analytics). View analytics by selecting the analytics icon on the top navigation bar.

## Manage analytics

While any user with access to premium Viva Engage will be able to access Engage Analytics, only **Microsoft 365 Global admin** and **Engage admin** can manage settings through the [Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac).

Within the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the admin option. Select **Admin** to enter the Engage admin center.

 Global admin and Engage admin can configure, enable, and disable analytics features through the admin portal to tailor the experience for their organization. To do this, navigate to the **Setup and configuration** tab within the Engage admin center and select **Manage analytics**.

>[!NOTE]
> Any leader’s delegates or delegate managers have visibility into the leader’s audience and personal analytics. A leader's audience must have at least *75% of users licensed* for audience analytics to be visible.

## Audience analytics  

In the **Manage analytics** interface shown above, Engage admin can adjust the level of sentiment analysis that is available to leaders and their delegates through the **Audience analytics** dashboard. This allows for unique levels of sentiment collection either at the audience level, theme-level, or conversation level.

Audience analytics help leaders and delegates monitor engagement within their audience on Viva Engage and can be accessed from the analytics icon on the top navigation bar or through the leader's storyline page.

In the **Manage analytics** interface, Engage admin can choose to enable or disable the top content creator feature for the organization. Enabling this feature displays employees and leaders who create the most campaign posts.

## Frequently asked questions

**How often are analytics updated?** Analytics refresh daily (every 24 hours). If you don’t see changes reflected right away, check analytics the next day.

**Where can users access analytics from?** Analytics can be accessed directly from the top navigation menu of Viva Engage by selecting the analytics icon (see above imagery for reference).

**Why can't my leader/delegate see audience analytics?** A leader and their delegate must be licensed users to view audience analytics. Additionally, at least 75% of the leader's audience must have a premium license for audience analytics to be visible to the leader or their delegate(s).
