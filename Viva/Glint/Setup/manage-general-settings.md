# Admin management of the General Settings feature in Viva Glint 

Details defining your Viva Glint programs are set up and viewed by selecting the **configuration** symbol on your Microsoft Viva Glint admin dashboard and then **General Settings** in the *Client Settings* section.  

Once you have designated your General Settings, they're valid for all your Viva Glint programs until you edit them. 

## Standard procedures for General Settings section setup 

For each setting option, you'll see a short description so you can feel confident about the choices you make. There are seven sections which require input: 

- [Company information](#set-up-the-company-information-section) 
- [Communications](#set-up-the-communications-section) 
- [Reporting](#set-up-the-reporting-section) 
- [Engage Survey Details](#set-up-the-engage-survey-details-section) 
- [Features](#set-up-the-features-section) 
- [Technical Configuration](#set-up-the-technical-configuration-section) 
- [Translations](#set-up-the-translations-section) 

>[!NOTE]
> Any changes you make in the General Settings will apply to all survey programs created in Viva Glint.
