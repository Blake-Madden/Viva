# Introduction and admin setup for Copilot in Viva Glint (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

HR users and leaders of large organizations spend a substantial amount of valuable time interpreting Glint survey results and comments. Copilot in Viva Glint enables them to understand and act on employee feedback by quickly summarizing large quantities of comments. 
Copilot in Viva Glint is available for all users in enabled roles whose teams meet the threshold for verbatim comment results.

## What is Copilot in Viva Glint?

Copilot in Viva Glint is built specifically to answer questions about your survey comments. It's your partner for all comment analysis and can:
- Summarize your comments
- Identify key themes across comments
- Summarize comments by demographics
- Summarize comments by items
- Identify what action employees are asking for

### Does Copilot have any limitations?

- Copilot works on completed survey cycles for Recurring and Ad hoc programs only. It isn’t currently available for Employee Lifecycle, Always-On, or 360 Feedback programs. 
- There must be at least one Recurring or Ad hoc program survey administered or closed on your Glint platform to use the feature. 
- Copilot doesn’t take quantitative survey results into consideration. It can’t answer questions that require comparison scores between questions or employee groups. 
- Any AI can make mistakes misrepresenting the information it finds. If you encounter harmful, inappropriate, or inaccurate Copilot in Viva Glint responses, immediately provide feedback or report a concern through our feedback button in Copilot in Viva Glint or in the Viva Glint app.
- Copilot samples a subset of comments from each question proportionate to the overall comment count per question. The current limit for this feature is 1000 comments.
- We’ll let you know when Copilot can manage language translations beyond its default English.

### Are more Copilot features planned?

### Deployment considerations

Think about:
- **Current usage** – does your rollout group have experience with Viva Glint?
- **Comment count** – do you expect a high number of comments?
- **Survey timing** – can you align with an upcoming survey? 
- **Comfort with AI** – can you leverage superusers to help others with the rollout?
- **Amount of change** – is your org already going through change? Is this the right time to add a new tool?

## Get the most out of Copilot in Viva Glint

Use our best practices to maximize the benefit from Copilot in Viva Glint:

Leverage your programs and survey formats that align with the strengths and current capabilities of Copilot in Viva Glint.  

- **Enable comments** – allows for more detailed feedback and context, enhancing the data's richness and usefulness for summarization purposes. This approach provides a comprehensive view of feedback, allowing the generation of accurate and insightful summaries.
- **Ask open-ended items** – Open-ended survey items capture a wide range of feedback. They allow respondents to freely express their thoughts on topics that may not be covered by the questions. These responses are typically more detailed and can reveal rich data insights not apparent from quantitative data alone.
- **Use relevant attribute filters** – Copilot in Viva Glint uses the attributes you send to Viva Glint to filter data. Enable filter attributes that are pertinent for the User Roles who will be interacting with Copilot to ensure that the insights and summaries are applicable and useful.
- **Use Recurring and Ad hoc programs** - Where it makes sense, leverage Recurring and Ad hoc programs. Currently Copilot in Viva Glint is unable to tap into Always-On and Employee Lifecycle programs. To maximize your ability to use Copilot in Viva Glint, use Recurring program setup for on-going topics (Engagement) and Ad hoc for one-off topics (Change Management). 

## Enable Copilot in Viva Glint

Prerequisites to enabling Copilot:
- You have at least one Recurring or Ad hoc survey administered or closed on the Viva Glint platform
- Your dashboard default language is set to English

Admins enable Copilot in Viva Glint. Microsoft privacy policies prohibit Copilot from being enabled by default for any User Roles. 

You must assign yourself and others using Copilot to a new User Role. Create a new User Role with access to the Comments Report enabled. Add that User Role to the survey program Reporting page, as described in *Grant User Roles Comment Reports access*:

The first step to enable Copilot for users is to select the roles who should have Comment Report access. Users without access to the Comment Report can’t access Copilot in Viva Glint.

### Grant User Roles Comment Report permission

From your admin dashboard, follow this process:

1.	Select the **configuration (cogwheel)** symbol.
2.	In the Employees section, select **User Roles**.
3.	Select the User Role to provide Comment Report access. In this example, we’ll select the Company Admin role.
