# Questions setup in Program Summary

The Questions page allows you to add or modify the items included in a survey. If you've selected a default template, Viva Glint recommended survey items are prepopulated. Refer to the [Learn about Viva Glint program design](/../../[training/modules/viva-glint-learn-about-viva-glint-program-design/) to learn to add or modify survey items.

## Use Viva Glint's prepopulated survey templates

Standard templates provide prepopulated questions and survey items, along with introductory and "thank you" text that you may customize.
