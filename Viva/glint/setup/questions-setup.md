# Questions setup in Program Summary

The Questions page allows you to add or modify the items included in a survey. If you've selected a default template, Viva Glint recommended survey items are prepopulated. Refer to the [Learn about Viva Glint program design](/../../[training/modules/viva-glint-learn-about-viva-glint-program-design/) to learn to add or modify survey items.

## Use Viva Glint's prepopulated survey templates

Standard templates provide prepopulated questions and survey items, along with introductory and "thank you" text that you may customize.

- Select languages from the **Language** dropdown menu. Languages already made available to your organization in General Settings are available here.
- Edit **Greeting** - "Hello" is prepopulated, but feel free to customize that in a way that's comfortable to you. 
- Edit **Text** - You will see dummy text in the **Text** box.
  - All of the text in this box can be edited.
  - The blue fields are *not* intended to be populated. **The blue fields are suggested areas for customization. To remove or customize the blue text, it must be deleted.** 

When finished, select **Save Changes**.

## Edit survey items using the vertical ellipses

Hover over the vertical ellipses next to any survey item to select one of the following options:

- Edit Targeting
- Edit Question
- Edit Display Logic
- Delete

### Edit Targeting

Adding a target to a specific question ensures that only the population targeted sees it within the survey. Using the search boxes, select a User Role to include or exclude. When finished, select **Save Changes**.

### Delete survey items

Remove this question (item) from the program.

## Edit 'Thank You!'

Customize the 'Thank You!' message for the survey by hovering over the box with the "Thank You!" message and select it. In the window that opens you can:

- Select languages
- Edit the greeting
- Edit the text content

When you've finished, select **Save Changes**.

## Add questions to a survey cycle

You can add questions to specific question cycles by selecting the corresponding question cycle number next to the question. For example, if you only want a certain question asked on the first survey, deselect all numbers except for 1.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Do not edit our standard survey items. Item edits may impact language translations and the item's intention, which would affect the accuracy of the benchmark tied to the question. Custom items are not mapped to external benchmarks.


>[!TIP]
>Now that your survey items are set up, move onto [Reporting setup in Program Summary](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230977).
