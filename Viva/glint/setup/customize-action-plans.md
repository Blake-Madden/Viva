# Customize Action Plans in Viva Glint    

Suggested Action templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint included as suggested resources to help managers achieve team-approved Focus Areas. Access Action Plan templates in **Content Resources** from *Action Taking* on your admin dashboard. 

## Viva People Science explains Focus Areas and action planning

Initiating and managing action after a survey can be an unclear process. Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. An action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience. It is designed to increase work engagement on your team and within the company.

## Understand terminology associated with action plans 

This terminology assists with understanding how Viva Glint sets up action plan templates: 

|Term|Definition|
|---------|---------|
|**Driver**|A factor that affects employee engagement, such as growth or culture. Survey items are developed to surface engagement drivers|
|**Suggested Action Templates**|The overall template associated with a survey item. Managers choose a **Focus Area** via the **Take Action** command within survey results and are then directed to the Suggested Action Template associated with that chosen key driver|
|**Suggested Action Items**|The components of a Suggested Action Template| 
|**Content Resources**|Articles, images, PDFs, and videos that make up Suggested Action Items|

## Specifications for adding Content Resources
