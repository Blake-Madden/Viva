# Customize Action Plans in Viva Glint    

Suggested Action templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint has included as suggested resources to help managers achieve team-approved focus areas. Access Action Plan templates in **Content Resources** from *Action Taking* on your admin dashboard. 

## Viva People Science explains focus areas and action planning

Initiating and managing action after a survey can be an unclear process. Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. An action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience, It is designed to increase work engagement on your team and within the company.

## Understand terminology associated with action plans 

This terminology assists with understanding how Viva Glint sets up action plan templates: 

|Term|Definition|
|---------|---------|
|**Driver**|A factor that affects employee engagement, such as growth or culture. Survey items are developed to surface engagement drivers|
|**Suggested Action Templates**|The overall template associated with a survey item. Managers choose a **Focus Area** via the **Take Action** command within survey results and are then directed to the Suggested Action Template associated with that chosen key driver|
|**Suggested Action Items**|The components of a Suggested Action Template| 
|**Content Resources**|Articles, images, PDFs, and videos that make up Suggested Action Items|

## Specifications for adding Content Resources 

All content that exists in *Content Resources* is considered **Viva Glint standard content**. Content may exist as articles, images, PDF files, or videos. Content must first exist or be added in *Content Resources* before it is attached to a Suggested Action template.

### Character limits for adding Content Resources**: 

| **Field** | **Character limit** | 
|---|---|
| **Name** | 100, no spaces |
| **Title** | 2048|
| **Description** | 50 K+ |
| **Rich text** | 50 K+ |
| **Image file name** | 255, include file extension |
| **PDF file name** | 255, include file extension |
| **Video link URL** | 5048 |

## Adding external links to Content Resources 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Content Resources**. 
1. Select **+ New**. 
1. Select **I Understand**, indicating that you understand that adding a new item, adds it for all languages. 
1. Add a title in the *Untitled Resource* section, select the **Resource Type** from the dropdown box, and add a description. 
1. Follow the on-screen guidance for adding the resource. 
1. Select **Save**. 

## Cloning customized standard content 

Edited content must be renamed before it is saved and published. This step is referred to as **creating a clone** and ensures that Viva Glint original content is never altered. 

|Column|Reference|Definition|
|---------|--------------|----------|
|**Shared**|Shared| Viva Glint standard content|
|**Shared**|Custom|New or customized content|
|**Last Modified**|Viva Glint Admin|Viva Glint standard content| 
|**Last Modified**|Your Customized Resource Name| New or customized content|

## Linking a new survey item to a Suggested Action Template 

Most standard survey items are automatically linked to a Suggested Action template by default. You can edit an existing template and link new items to it. *This creates a new template (clone) that you'll rename.*

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action Templates**. 
1. Choose the template to add an item to from the **Name** column. You see the item(s) linked to the template. An item may appear twice if the item scale was different between surveys. Hover over the item to see where the item was used and the point scale assigned to it. 
1. Select the **pencil** symbol to edit. 
1. Use the dropdown menu to **find the new question**. Type in the key driver or a few words from the item to search and find it.
1. Select **Update**. The new item now shows in the *Questions* section.
1. Select **Save**. The *Create new Suggested Action Template* name box opens. *This step prevents the original template from being altered.*
1. Insert a name that resonates with you, for ease of finding it later. 
1. Select **Done**. *Your new Suggested Action Template now appears as a Custom template*.

   > [!NOTE]
   >Suggested Action Templates update in real time. Often standard survey items are shared across multiple survey programs. You may be updating a template currently in use. Be sure the addition is useful to anyone choosing this template. 

## Editing a suggested action item 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action**.  
1. Select the template from the **Name** column. 
1. On the template page, under *Suggested Action Items*, tap the action to be edited and select the **pencil** symbol. 
1. On the *Resource* page, edit the title, add to, or edit the description, add, or edit video link. 

## Moving a Suggested Action item 

1. Tap the action item to be reordered. 
1. Use the three horizontal lines to drag and place the item elsewhere in the list.  

## Deleting a Suggested Action item
  
1. Tap the action item to be deleted. 
1. Select the **trash can** symbol.

## Adding default action items to a Suggested Action Template 

Default Action Items will automatically appear anytime a new Focus Area is created for that item. For any Suggested Action Item that your company wants users to review, tap on the item and select **Move to Default**.

## Deleting Custom Content Resources

Custom content is identified within the column labeled *Shared* in *Content Resources* on the admin dashboard.

To delete custom content, it can't be associated with any Action Plan or any other resources. 
Select the **trash can** symbol next to the custom resource. If any dependencies exist, the name(s) of the dependency will display:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/delete-content-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Delete Content Resource dialog box." lightbox="../../media/glint/reports/delete-content-resource.png":::

Select **Got It!** and then you've removed the custom content from the associated resources. Select the **trash can** symbol. 

When there are no dependencies, the *Are you sure?* dialog box displays. Select your appropriate answer.
