# Viva Glint 360 competencies and survey guidance

This section covers program competencies, survey guidance, report access and timing, and global reporting guidance. 

## Competencies

Competencies are a set of verifiable characteristics and skills that enable and improve the efficiency of performing work. 

- A Glint 360 cycle can include a maximum of 150 competencies. 
- The typical number is in the range 3-10. 
- Except for the Competency Name and Description, competencies can't be added or deleted once a cycle is live. 
- Competencies map only to ratings questions. 
- The Glint Manager 360 template includes 13 competencies mapped to template rating questions. 
- To go live, a cycle must have at least one competency-question mapping. Each competency must map to at least one question.

## Develop a competency model

Develop a competency model which is relevant to the success criteria for your organization. Follow these recommended steps:

- Collect information on what is considered success behaviors.
- Draft critical behavioral statements.
- Validate the competency model by comparing 360 results to desired business outcomes. 

Repeat this process for each major demographic.

## Question mapping

To maximize the reporting experience, map all ratings questions to at least one competency. Although a competency can map to more than one rating question, a rating question can map to only one competency. 

Procedure to map a competency to a question that is already mapped to another competency:

1.	Go to the other competency and remove its mapping to that question
1.	Return to the other competency to map the question.

### Customizing a competency and mapping it to a question

Repeat this procedure until you have mapped all competencies to at least one question:

1.	In Cycle Settings, select **Competencies & Reporting**. The *Competencies & Reporting* page opens.  The Competencies section shows the number of questions mapped to each competency.
2.	Select the competency to be customized or mapped.
3.	Assign values to the Competency Name and Competency Description fields. This text is used in reports
4.	Select at least one question to map to the competency. To search for a question, begin entering the question label in the *Search Question* field. 
5.	Select **Save Changes.**

### Adding a competency

To add a competency to a cycle:

1.	In Cycle Settings, select **Competencies & Reporting**. 
2.	In Competencies, select **Competency**. The *Add Competency* window opens.
3.	Assign values to the Competency Name and Competency Description fields.
4.	Select at least one question to map to the competency. 
5.	Select **Save Changes.**

### Removing a competency

To remove a competency from a cycle:

1.	In *Cycle Settings*, select **Competencies & Reporting**.
2.	Go to **Competencies**. 
3.	Hover over the competency to be removed. 
4.	Select the **trash can symbol** next to the competency. 
5.	Select **Delete** in the confirmation dialog box.
