# 360 User Roles and permissions

By default, people in the Viva Glint admin role have access to create and edit all Glint programs, including 360s. You may, however, choose to setup an additional user role to *only* have access to edit 360 programs. In this case, you first need to create a user role - or adjust an existing user role - to have exclusive 360 admin permissions. 

More information on [Create a Viva Glint User Role](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230740).

## Create a unique 360 User Role

From the Glint admin dashboard, select the **Configuration symbol** and then **User Roles.** 

1.	If you created a user role specifically for 360 feedback program administration, select this role. If youâ€™re adding a new 360 feedback admin role, select **+ New Role.**
1.	In the *Untitled Role* page that opens, name your User Role by selecting the **pencil symbol**. Choose a name which easily identifies your cycle.
1.	Select **Permissions** and scroll down to the *Feedback* section of the page.

4.  Enable **Access 360 feedback**.
5.	Select **Manage Feedback** to allow anyone in this role to edit 360 programs.  
6.	Select **Save Changes** and then **Save Permissions**.
