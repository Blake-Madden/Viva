# Assign Viva Glint admins

Welcome to Microsoft Viva Glint! If you have landed on this page, you should already have your tenant provisioned.

- If you haven't already completed tenant provisioning, [set up a Microsoft Viva tenant](viva-glint-tenant-provision.md).
- If you have completed tenant provisioning, follow these next steps to continue Viva Glint deployment:

## Assign Viva Glint admins in the Microsoft Administrator Center (MAC)

As the tenant Global Admin, you're the default Microsoft Viva Glint Service Admin. This means you have ultimate control over the subscriptions in your Viva Glint product and you can access all data. Additionally - **and importantly** - you can assign Viva Glint Service admin roles to other users.

1. Ensure that all Glint service admin users have their First Name, Last Name, Employee ID, and Email populated in Microsoft Entra. [Manage Entra user profile information](/fundamentals/how-to-manage-user-profile-info).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To prevent duplication errors with future file uploads, ensure that the Employee ID values for these users match the Employee ID from the HR Information System (HRIS) that will be used to transfer data to Viva Glint.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Admin Center (MAC)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264234). 
1. Go to **Settings** and select **Viva**.
