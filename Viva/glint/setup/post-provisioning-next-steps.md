# Set up your Viva Glint instance

Welcome to Microsoft Viva Glint! If you have landed on this page, you should already have your tenant provisioned.

- If you haven't already completed tenant provisioning, [set up a Microsoft Viva tenant](viva-glint-tenant-provision.md)
- If you have completed tenant provisioning, follow these next steps to continue Viva Glint deployment.

## Add administrators to your Viva Glint instance

If the person who purchased your Microsoft business subscription assigned you the highest Viva Glint admin role, you're the Global Service Admin. This means you have control over the subscriptions in your Viva Glint product and you can access all data.

Additionally, you can assign admin roles to other users. Administrators for Viva Glint are assigned within the Viva Glint product using the User Roles feature, not the Microsoft Administrator Center (MAC).

Assign other admin roles within the Viva Glint User Roles feature, naming them in a way that clearly identifies their specific responsibilities:

- Service Admin: A specific admin role to help manage the Viva Glint product. Admins can set up program settings and surveys, distribution lists, and reporting features, and support your managers in all aspects of action taking.
- Viva Glint recommends no more than five (5) administrators for your Viva Glint instance.

Glint recommends no more than 5 Viva Glint service administrators for your Viva Glint instance
