# Manager Quick Guide to understanding and acting on survey results and avoiding pitfalls

It's not uncommon for managers to struggle to use survey results as tools to have quality conversations with their teams. Whether they're a manager with years of experience, or a new manager seeing Viva Glint results for the first time, it is an exciting - but sometimes unnerving - experience. With so much data available, it can be easy to fall into some negative behaviors and thought patterns when interpreting results.

The Viva People Science team has identified common pitfalls that managers might encounter when owning their own survey results. The best way to combat these pitfalls is to equip them with the knowledge that *pitfalls do exist* and then guide them on how to avoid them.

The role of manager is central to the success of a continued conversation approach to having happier employees and improving business. Commit to your employee’s feedback survey strategy by:

- Become familiar with the Viva Glint platform and interpreting feedback results.
- Discuss survey results with your teams and peers.
- Take small, visible, data-driven action.
- Have on-going conversations with your team about progress.

## Quick tips for managers avoiding common pitfalls of feedback interpretation

It’s easy to interpret survey results in a way that is neither helpful to you or your team. Review the common pitfalls of feedback interpretation and know how to avoid them. 

|Common survey interpretation pitfalls|How to avoid pitfalls and take positive action instead|
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|Rushing to action|Refrain from jumping into solution mode. Check in with your team before deciding on Focus Areas for your action plan.|
Taking on too much at once or areas outside of your control|It’s tempting to take it all on, but you'll be more effective if you choose one, at most two, Focus Areas. You might actually see survey scores decline if you take on too many Focus Areas all at once.|
|Analysis paralysis|Use this three-question framework to get started: 
- What's most important?
- How am I doing?
- What is my top priority?|
|Taking results personally; getting lost in the negative, failing to celebrate the positive and explore the neutral|Stay balanced by first noting and celebrating the positives. Then explore the negatives and neutrals, regarding them as a business exercise. Remain objective and open to learning. Adopt a growth mindset - everyone can continuously learn and improve. Treat feedback like a gift.|
|Prioritizing comments over scores|	Read the comments last, after you understand strengths and weaknesses from the scores. Use comments only to clarify what the scores are telling you.|
|Trying to identify who said what|This breaks trust and make people fearful of giving honest feedback that will help you improve. Most companies have a zero-tolerance policy for misusing data in this way.|
|Discounting low scores due to situational factors (e.g., organizational changes, negative press)|Various factors will impact your scores, including situational factors. Survey results provide valuable insights to help improve your leadership capability, and in turn, better support your team through challenging times. Regardless of the cause, if people’s experiences are negative, it is your responsibility as a leader to understand and help address them.|
|Focusing on the score rather than meaningful action|Remember the survey is intended to help you focus on the right actions to improve the employee experience. Use the data to look forward and understand what/how you can improve over time.|
|Setting goals or targets|If you need to set goals related to the survey, focus next steps on small actions you can take, rather than about a score you want to change.|
|Searching for external best practices, rather than getting feedback on what’s meaningful at your organization.|Issues tend to be local and personal. Talk to your peers, your team, and your leader to better understand what actions will be most meaningful at your company.|
