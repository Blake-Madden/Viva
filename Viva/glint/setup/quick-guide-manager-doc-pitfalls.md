# Manager Quick Guide to understanding and acting on survey results and avoiding pitfalls

It's not uncommon for managers to struggle to use their results as tools to have quality conversations with their teams. Whether they are a manager with years of experience, or a new manager seeing Viva Glint results for the first time, it is an exciting - but sometimes unnerving - experience. With so much data available, it can be really easy to fall into some negative behaviors and thought patterns when interpreting results.

The Viva People Science team has identified common pitfalls that managers might encounter when owning their own survey results. The best way to combat these pitfalls is to equip them with the knowledge that *pitfalls do exist* and then guide them on how to avoid them.

The role of manager is central to the success of a continued conversation approach to having happier employees and improving business. Commit to your employee’s feedback survey strategy by:

- Become familiar with the Viva Glint platform and interpreting feedback results.
- Discuss survey results with your teams and peers.
- Take small, visible, data-driven action.
- Have on-going conversations with your team about progress.

## Quick tips for managers avoiding common pitfalls of feedback interpretation

It’s easy to interpret survey results in a way that is neither helpful to you or your team. Review the common pitfalls of feedback interpretation and know how to avoid them. 

|Common survey interpretation pitfalls|How to avoid pitfalls and take positive action instead|
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|Rushing to action|Refrain from jumping into solution mode. Check in with your team before deciding on Focus Areas for your action plan.|
Taking on too much at once or areas outside of your control|It’s tempting to take it all on, but you'll be more effective if you choose one, at most two, Focus Areas. You might actually see survey scores decline if you take on too many Focus Areas all at once.|
|Analysis paralysis|Use this three-question framework to get started: 
- What's most important?
- How am I doing?
- What is my top priority?|
