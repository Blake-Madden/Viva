> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

Selecting subjects can be done manually or through an upload, if you’re adding a large number of subjects. 

## Manual addition of 360 subjects

1. Search for the employee’s name in *Add a Subject*. Begin to type an employee’s name.
2. Select it from the dropdown menu.
3. The subject name will now appear in the *Manage Subjects* box.

## Bulk addition of subjects and coaches

1.	Select **Import Subjects**.
2.	In the window that appears, select **Download CSV**.
3.	Populate the .csv file with subject unique IDs and email addresses and then add the names by selecting **Upload**.

>[!NOTE]
> Coach assignment is optional, and selection is up to your organization. Managers are often coaches but don’t have to be. Coaches guide subjects though their 360 report and are automatically granted report access.
