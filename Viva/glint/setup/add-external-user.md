# Manage external users in Viva Glint

Grant access to and remove Microsoft Viva Glint Support users to assist in deployment, advanced insights analysis, and complex Support tasks. The Support User role is designed to grant the right permissions to external users, like Microsoft Partners, and allow Viva Glint Admins to quickly audit how many Support users have access to their Viva Glint application.

> [!NOTE]
> Support users must be added to your Microsoft Entra ID before you can add them in Viva Glint.

## Add a Support or Partner user

To add a user:

1. From the admin dashboard, select the **Configure** symbol, then in **Employees** , choose **People**.
2. In the **Actions** dropdown menu, select **Add a Support User**.
3. Enter the First Name, Last Name, and Email on file in Microsoft Entra ID for this user.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Users must be added to Viva Glint and Entra ID with a company email address for your organization. For instructions on adding users in Entra ID: [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252181).
   
4. The **Company Admin User Role** will be selected by default and grants Support users the required level of access to assist in your Viva Glint account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For Partner users, add the user to the Partner Employees User Role as well.

5. Switch the **External user** toggle to **Yes** to flag external users within your organization.
6. Switch the **Grant user advanced configuration access** setting to **Yes** to allowSupport users access to **Advanced Configuration** features.
7. Select **Add support user.**

> [!CAUTION]
> Users with access to Advanced Configuration settings can make changes to potentially sensitive areas of your Viva Glint configuration. For an Advanced Configuration overview, see [Understand Advanced Configuration options in Viva Glint.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2240194)

1. From the admin dashboard, select the **Configure** symbol, then in **Employees** , choose **People**.
2. In the **Search People** field, enter the first and last name or email address of the user.
3. In the search results, select the desired user.
