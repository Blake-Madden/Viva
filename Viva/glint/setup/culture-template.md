# Use the Viva Glint Culture survey template

Overview

The Viva Glint culture survey contains items that measure the facets of culture Viva People Science knows to be important predictors of business performance and engagement. The Culture Survey is available in all languages supported by Viva Glint.

Details
How does Glint define culture and why is an organizationâ€™s culture important?

At Glint, we believe organizational culture is driven by mindsets, values and shared beliefs. These components influence how decisions get made, how people behave, shape our experiences and determine how work gets done.

How does Glint measure culture?

Glint focuses on measuring observable group behaviors that impact important performance outcomes. This approach is proven to be the most valid way of measuring organizational culture. It is important to measure culture by asking about the group, rather than about an individual, because culture is a group phenomenon that is created and reinforced through the interactions of many. By rating various group behaviors, rather than asking people what they think or how they feel, the survey questions are also more actionable.
