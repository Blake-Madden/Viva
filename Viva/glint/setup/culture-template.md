# Use the Viva Glint Culture survey template

Recognizing that most executives and leaders realize the importance and impact of culture on business outcomes, Viva Glint offers a Culture Survey template as part of its library of Engage Surveys. The Viva Glint culture survey contains items that measure the facets of culture Viva People Science knows to be important predictors of business performance and engagement. The Culture Survey is available in all languages supported by Viva Glint.

## How Viva Glint defines culture and why an organization’s culture is important

Viva Glint research backs the fact that culture is driven by mindsets, values and shared beliefs. These components influence how decisions get made, how people behave, shape our experiences, and determine how work gets done.

## How does Viva Glint measure culture?

Viva Glint focuses on measuring observable group behaviors that impact important performance outcomes. This approach is the most valid way of measuring organizational culture. It's important to measure culture by asking about the group, rather than about an individual. Culture is a group phenomenon which is created and reinforced through the interactions of many. By rating various group behaviors, rather than asking individuals what they think or how they feel, the survey items are also more actionable.

## Key outcomes and goals of a culture survey program

A cultural measure is intended to help executive leaders check on the alignment of their intended culture against the actual culture experienced by employees. The survey can inform priorities and actions that require attention at the organizational level. The Viva Glint culture survey will answer whether your company has the culture needed to be successful in the future. 

Other outcomes can be determined if you choose to add more questions, such as:
- Current culture
- Safety
- Innovation
- Trust
- Inclusiveness

## What does the Viva Glint culture survey include?

- Research-validated survey to measure eight key outcomes of culture
- Key drivers to understand how cultural behaviors influence engagement and business outcomes 
- Access to intuitive and insightful data at the executive level
- Narrative Intelligence to synthesize open-ended feedback and surface key themes 
- Easy integration of Culture items into existing agile survey programs
- Cultural benchmarks

## What kind of organization is the culture survey intended for?

This survey program is intended for organizations who are interested in gaining a baseline understanding of their current culture to support transformation. Transformation can include identifying an ideal culture to move toward or can be in accordance with a business or leadership change. Organizations going through a merger or acquisition often use culture as an indicator to support a smooth integration.

> [!TIP]
> Include all employees for the most accurate insight into your organization’s cultural health. Including all employees also creates awareness and support for cultural transformation.

## Investing in culture is good for business 

Companies that proactively manage their culture show:

- 516% higher revenue growth over a 10 year period
- 30% higher levels of innovation
- 40% higher retention

## Should our culture survey be combined with other Viva Glint survey programs?

​​​Combining culture and engagement surveys is not recommended. Length and competing core drivers are often hard for participants to manage.

There is, however, an opportunity to measure culture in every stage of the employee lifecycle, from recruiting to exit.

## Best Practice recommendations for cultural transformation

- **Define, state, and role model your organization’s collective culture and values.**
- **Align your desired culture with all aspects of the employee experience.** Reinforce culture across the employee lifecycle, including hiring, onboarding, development, performance practices, engagement, and exit. Consider connecting cultural insights you can get from data sources like onboarding surveys, engagement pulses, and exit interviews.
- **Ask employees about their cultural experience regularly.** Viva Glint recommends asking employees about their cultural experience annually to be sure that the desired culture is the one that employees are experiencing.
- **Build trust by ensuring cultural consistency and alignment.** People learn by observation and repetition. A strong culture is one that is predictable.
