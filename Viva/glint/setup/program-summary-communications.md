# Communications setup in Program Summary

Learn how to notify employees about upcoming surveys, the window for taking a survey, and provide the survey in preferred languages.

>[!NOTE]
> If you're configuring an Always-On program, skip this step.

There are two sections to set up on the Communications page:
- Notification Timing
- Configure Notifications

## Notification Timing

::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-config-notifications-.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure Notifications section in Communications setup.":::

Send survey invites and reminders between these times that you set. Your organization's default time zone is preset in [General Settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230744).

## Configure Notifications

>[!TIP]
>When [personal email is set up](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2247991) as an optional system attribute, select an **Email Settings** option to send to company or company and personal email.

The following fields display as default setup actions and each field can be edited by selecting the **pencil symbol** that displays after selecting a row:

### Survey Start invitation

::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-survey-invite-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Survey Invitation slider window for the Communications setup page.":::

The date your program is scheduled to be emailed is shown. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> At this time, no edits can be made to the survey invitation message. If you'd like to preview it, select the **pencil symbol** in the Survey Start row to open the Survey Invitation slider window. You may change the language and preview the message in additional languages.

### Use reminders

Survey reminders can go out as often as you believe necessary. You may send up to 3 and additionally, a final reminder.

[!TIP]
Send 2 survey reminders per program. Survey takers will only receive reminders if they haven't completeled their survey. 

Use the **Pencil symbol** to open the slider window and then you can:
- Change reminder send dates already preset
- Preview your reminder. At this time the reminder message cannot be edited. You may change the language and preview the message in additional languages.

#### Add survey reminders

The dropdown menu on ther **Add survey Reminder** button lets you add reminders.

### Survey End reminder

At this time, this reminder is unavailable for viewing or editing.

After adding and editing reminder dates as needed, select the right facing arrow at the bottom right side of the page and then **Save and Continue.**

## Notifications for leaders with Team Conversations enabled




## Understand the results notification email

The results notification email is a one-time notification to let users know that results are available to them. The email goes out to those users in roles with **live** reporting access 24-hours prior to the time of the email to all others (including phased access). Best practice is to make sure that roles are programmed and aligned before survey closes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access must be scheduled to be live 24 hours before the results notification email is scheduled for sending.
