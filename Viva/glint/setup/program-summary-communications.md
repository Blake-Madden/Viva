There are two sections to set up on the Communications page:
- Notification Timing
- Configure Notifications

## Notification Timing

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-notification-timing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notifications Timing section in Communications setup.":::

Send survey invites and reminders between the times that you set. Your organization's default time zone is preset in [General Settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230744).

The following sections display as setup actions and each field can be edited by selecting the **pencil symbol** that displays after selecting a row.

>[!TIP]
>When [personal email is set up](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2247991) as an optional system attribute, select the **Email Settings** option to send to company or company and personal email.

### Use the Survey invitation window

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-survey-invitation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Survey Invitation slider window for the Communications setup page.":::

### Use Reminders

You may send up to three reminders during the survey window and also a final reminder.

>[!TIP]
>Send 2 survey reminders per program. Survey takers will only receive reminders if they haven't completeled their survey. 

Use the **Pencil symbol** to open the slider window and then:
- Change reminders send dates already preset
- Preview your reminder. At this time, the reminder message cannot be edited. You may change the language and preview the message in other languages.

## Notifications when survey results are available

The results notification email is a one-time notification to let users know that results are available to them. The email goes out to users in roles with **live** reporting access 24-hours before the email to all others (including phased access). Best practice is to make sure that roles are programmed and aligned before your survey closes.
