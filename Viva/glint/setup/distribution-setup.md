# Set up Distribution page in Program Summary

The Distribution page in Program Summary allows you to choose the people in your organization that will receive this program’s survey. User lists are updated when your Employee Data Files are uploaded to ensure that the most current data file is in use before each survey launch.   

In this step, you use existing Distribution Lists or will need to create new ones. Refer to this [Creating Distribution Lists](https://www.microsoft.com) page to create or modify your lists.  

## Procedure for setting up Distribution page

1. Use the **Search** field to include **Distribution for this Program**.   
1. Use the **Search** field to **Exclude Groups**.  
1. Select the right-facing arrow symbol to **Save & Continue**. 

## Download survey recipients 

Select **Download Recipients** to generate an *.xlsx* list of current Distribution List members. A dialog box appears where you may optionally add more detail to your spreadsheet.

   > [!TIP]
   > Use the export function to validate the member list after you have added or created a Distribution List. 

## Modify an existing Distribution List 

Select the pencil symbol to **Modify Distribution Lists**.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Modifying a Distribution List will affect any programs using it.
