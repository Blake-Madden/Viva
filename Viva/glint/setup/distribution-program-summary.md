# Set up Distribution Lists in Program Summary

Distribution is the second area to set up within Program Summary. Program Setup must be set up first and shows a checkmark on the right to confirm that you are ready to move to Distribution. On the Distribution page, choose which of your organization's populations receive this program's survey by using existing Distribution Lists or creating new ones.

To view a spreadsheet of people already populated to receive this program, select **Download Recipients**. 

An **Exporting Member Data** window will open. This export includes all individuals (first name, last name, email address, and status) targeted by this survey. Any recent edits to this programâ€™s distribution may take a few minutes to update before reflected in the export. Choose whether to include all user roles. Select **Export**.

When this process is complete, you will receive this message:

## Add Distribution Lists for this program

In this section, use the search panel to select Distribution Lists. Remember that Distribution Lists are set up before the survey set up stage, in [Managing features and settings](/../../viva/glint/setup/set-up-distribution-lists).

The search panel opens a dropdown menu of Distribution Lists already available for your programs. Select one or more Distribution Lists, the right facing arrow will highlight, then select that to **Save and Continue**
