# Set up Distribution Lists in Program Summary

Distribution is the second area to set up within Program Summary. Program Setup must be set up first and shows a checkmark on the right to confirm that you are ready to move to Distribution.
On the Distribution page, choose which of your organization's populations receive this program's survey by using existing Distribution Lists or creating new ones.
