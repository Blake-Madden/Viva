# Question mapping

Once questions are selected that align to your organizational strategies, you may decide to compare trending data from previous surveys to your current survey. If you do decide to compare historical data to new items moving forward, it's vital that the previous and new questions are truly comparable. 

If historical data isn't aligned to new insights, results can be misinterpreted if there aren't clear connections from historical data to new insights. To ensure true comparisons between previous and new results, it's essential to **map** items accurately before proceeding to act.​ 

## Mapping guidelines 

To map, consider the wording, item intention and referents.

### Item intention 

If items have different wording, they can still be mapped, provided the intention of the historical item aligns with the intention of the item it’s being mapped to – they must have the same aimed purpose and outcome:

### Item referent 

To gain specific insights, an item will always have a referent (for example, Company, senior leadership, direct manager, team, coworkers or even the employee themselves). If two items have similar intentions but are aimed at different referents, they can't be mapped.
