# Set up a Viva Glint Magnet/RN Excellence survey

Using the Viva Glint platform, organizations can view invaluable data from their RNs and identify risks and opportunities in real-time. The solution can be launched as a standalone or added onto an engagement or company survey and analyzed alongside other engagement data.

Viva Glint offers the items needed for an Registered Nurse (RN) Excellence survey. The items available are approved by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) for hospitals/clinics looking to attain or maintain Magnet® status in Nursing. Magnet status is a prestigious honor, which certifies that the RNs at that entity or system are highly skilled in terms of providing great care. There are many core criteria a hospital must meet to become Magnet-certified, one of which is RN satisfaction, and together with Viva Glint, the preset survey template can help with that certification. Our RN Excellence survey was created in conjunction with the guidance and expertise of ANCC analysts and approved by those analysts in May of 2018. The survey meets all RN Satisfaction criteria laid out by current Application Manuals, as well. 

Working with the ANCC, Glint’s People Scientists constructed a survey solution that assessed the seven nursing satisfaction categories required for Exemplary Professional Practice Evidence of Outcomes as laid out in the EP3EO (2014 Magnet Application Manual) and the EP2EO (2019 Magnet ApplicationManual). The survey takes just 3-4 minutes to complete and was approved by the ANCC for inclusion in the Magnet Recognition Program® in May of 2018.
