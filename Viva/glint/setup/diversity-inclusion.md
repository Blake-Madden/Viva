# Diversity and Inclusion survey program in Viva Glint

Fostering a strong sense of belonging in your organization is essential. Customer data shows that those employees who feel a strong sense of belonging are over six times as likely to be engaged as those who don’t. Belonging is strong when work environments are inclusive of differences, everyone feels accepted, and can bring their best selves to work.
Using the Microsoft Viva Glint Diversity and Inclusion approach, organizations can measure perspectives that matter, empower managers to build inclusive practices, and understand how to create an environment where all people feel they belong.

> [!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint survey strategy can incorporate domains of diversity, belonging and inclusion into any survey, voiding the need for a standalone Diversity and Inclusion measurement. For this reason, consider adding items from Glint's Diversity and Inclusion survey template to an engagement or a culture survey.
