# Set up Viva Glint Secure File Transfer Protocol

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) ensures efficient and secure transfer of data at a frequency that makes the most sense for your organization and is widely used across businesses to encrypt data in transit.

SFTP is the most secure way to transfer employee information. The automated feed enables you to keep your HRIS data coordinated with Microsoft Viva Glint and has several advantages.

- You can send surveys and results to the right participants at any time.
- For automatically triggered events, the data feed ensures that information goes to the right people at the right time, automatically.
- Each cycle has the most up-to-date employee data.
