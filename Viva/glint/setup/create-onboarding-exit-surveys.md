# Create a Viva Glint onboarding survey 

Microsoft Viva Glint believes that ongoing, frequent communications to solicit and collect employee feedback is crucial to an organization’s success. Viva Glint offers programs as a way for customers to send short, targeted surveys to their employees, which will deliver rich insights that translate into actionable opportunities to improve business.

The Viva Glint Onboarding Employee Lifecycle survey provides data about how a new hire feels about their introduction to your organization and its culture.

Our Viva People Science team continually updates Viva Glint survey templates so that they're always relevant in the current world of work.

## Creating a people-centric organization begins with onboarding

We have all been new employees at one time or another. We start with excitement for the future, anticipation of challenges to come, and desire for belonging with new colleagues. With effective people practices, hopes can become a reality, and we can go on to become happy and successful in our new roles. Successful onboarding experiences can increase new hires’ self-efficacy, role clarity, social integration, and learning in the short-term, and can increase performance, retention, and organizational commitment.

## Why is onboarding so important? 

Research shows it typically takes 12 months for new hires to reach their full performance potential, but many organizations continue to think of onboarding as just a few events, often focusing on orientation and risk early disengagement and undesirable attrition. 

- 56% of newly onboarded employees are likely to consider changing jobs within a year (Microsoft 2022 Work Trend Index) 
- 30% of new hires have left a job in first 90 days 
- With the “Great Reshuffle” trend, many people are rethinking where, when, and why they work 

This information creates a unique opportunity for organizations to rethink their onboarding experience to direct their new hires’ excitement and curiosity to sustainable, positive outcomes.
