# Opting into external benhmarks



















For an initial survey, when no historical data exists, most organizations are interested in seeing how their scores compare to an external benchmark, to begin orienting themselves to their results. Glint has more than 180 survey questions with benchmark data by industry, function, and country.

External benchmarks are helpful initially, but as you begin to survey more frequently, trends and internal comparisons become more useful for making incremental improvements in areas that matter most to teams.

The external benchmark is useful for company admins to provide a meaningful reference point in assessing an organization's overall scores, however individual managers shouldn't heavily focus on the external benchmark. For them, the internal comparison and their own team's past survey scores are better comparisons.
