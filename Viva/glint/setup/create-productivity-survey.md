# Create a Viva Glint productivity survey

The Microsoft Viva People Science team took a human-centric approach to define and operationalize employee productivity. They identified the critical opinions and attitudes that best characterize the experience and feeling of high productivity in the workplace. The outcome of this research produced a clear marker:

## Engagement and productivity are related, but distinct 

Engagement survey items shouldn't be used for measuring productivity. Different employee experiences impact feeling **engaged** versus feeling **productive**. Both are needed to drive high-performance, but beyond a focus on engagement alone, employee productivity experiences help drive higher levels of productivity and achieve better businesses outcomes. 

## Productivity as an Outcome

Glint always proposes using the items *eSat* and *Recommend* as engagement outcome measures in surveys. Now, with recent research into productivity as an outcome, consider adding two validated productivity outcomes to your listening strategy: **Individual Productivity** and **Team Productivity**. 

To capture the full picture of productivity, use these survey items to create a Productivity Index:

- I feel like I am productive at work.
- I feel like my team is productive at work. 

If there is a particular organizational goal or strategy you're focusing on that is best suited to individual or team productivity, just use the appropriate item. Our research shows that factors that contribute to higher perceptions of **team productivity** differ from those contributing to higher perceptions of **individual productivity**. It’s important to match measurement strategy and action taking steps to the level of productivity your organization wishes to drive. For most customers starting to measure productivity, we recommend using both outcome items.

## Instances where a productivity survey can benefit your org

Consider the productivity level (team and/or individual) you wish to improve, and use it as a guidepost for which employee experiences to focus on. Here are some examples:

## Set up a productivity survey

???? Craig - should we suggest here to start with a blank, recurring survey template or 

- **Engagement Survey** – Continue with an existing engagement survey but update it t to receive feedback to focus on productivity.


## Viva Glint suggested productivity survey items

???? CRAIG...should they use eSAT, Recommend, and then the following items? Goal here is to suggest the easiest method to achieve productivity analyses.


|Item Name|	Item Text|
|-------|--------|
|Team Collaboration|Teams at <COMPANY_NAME> collaborate effectively to get things done.|
|Leadership|I have confidence in the leadership team.
