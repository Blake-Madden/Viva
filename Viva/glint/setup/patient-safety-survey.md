# Set up a Viva Glint Patient Safety survey 

Many healthcare customers move to the Viva Glint patient safety survey to assess and improve their patient safety culture. It was approved as a reliable measure of patient culture by Leapfrog's expert panel in the spring of 2020 and is among the most succinct Leapfrog-approved safety surveys currently available. Seamlessly integrated with Viva Glint, patient safety survey insights are designed to get to healthcare leaders clearly and quickly. 

## Save time using Viva Glint's safety survey  
Gynelle Miller, Lead Patient Safety and Reliability Specialist at Corewell Health, said that compared to their old safety survey reporting process, her team saved approximately 200 hours of time leveraging Viva Glint patient safety survey insights on the Viva Glint platform!
