# Create an SSH key pair

To access your Microsoft Viva Glint SFTP account, create an SSH key pair, which includes a public and private key.

## Understand SSH key pair requirements

To connect to your Viva Glint SFTP account, ensure that the SSH key pair:

- Has a key length of as least 2048, ideally 4096 bits.
- Is type RSA in OpenSSH format.

> [!TIP]
> Passphrases are optional for key files. To omit, leave blank when prompted.

## Create an SSH key pair on Microsoft Windows

To create a key pair on Microsoft Windows operating systems:

1. Download PuTTy Key Generator [PuTTygen.exe file](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and run it.
1. In the **Key** menu, select **SSH-2 RSA Key**.
1. In **Parameters**, select the **RSA** option.
1. In **Number of bits in generated key field**, enter at least 2048, ideally 4096.
1. In **Actions**, select **Generate**.
1. A progress bar will appear. In the blank area under the bar, move your pointer in a random pattern to complete key pair generation.
1. When generation completes, copy the contents of the **Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file** field and past into a text editor application (like Notepad).
1. Save your file as **vivaglint-yyyymmdd.pub**.
1. **Key passphrase** and **Confirm passphrase** fields aren't required, leave blank for no passphrase.
1. Select **Save private key** to save the private key file. This is the key you use to connect to SFTP in a dedicated FTP application.

## Create an SSH key pair on Macintosh or Linux

To create a key pair on Macintosh or Linux operating systems:

1. Open a **Terminal** window. in Macintosh operating systems, find **Terminal** in the **Dock** or in the **Utilities** folder.
1. Enter the following command: ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -C "your_username" -f filename
   1. The length, determined by -b, should be at least 2048, ideally 4096.
   1. Update **your_username** and **filename** values. 
   1. Example: ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -C "**jsmith**" -f **vivaglint-yyyymmdd**
1. Select **enter** and follow prompts.
1. A passphrase isn't required. Supply a passphrase or leave blank and select **enter** to continue.
1. When successfully generated, you see these messages:
   1. Your identification has been saved in **filename**.
   1. Your public key has been saved in **filename.pub**.
1. Search for the public and private key files in **Finder**.
   1. The 2 key files are named based on what was specified in the Terminal command
      1. Example: **vivaglint-yyyymmdd** and **vivaglint-yyyymmdd.pub**
   1. With no specified file name, the key files appear as: **id_rsa** and **id_rsa.pub**.
