# Viva Glint 360 feedback program overview

The Microsoft Viva Glint 360 feedback program and process gives insight into a manager's strengths and opportunities with a specific, long-term focus on improvement.

## 360 Feedback process

The Microsoft Viva Glint 360 Feedback process gives employees insight into their strengths and opportunities from a variety of viewpoints. Rather than relying solely on the perspective of an immediate supervisor or manager, 360s invite multiple perspectives. 

360s are also known as multi-rater feedback, multisource feedback, or multisource assessments. 

Research shows that 85% of people struggle with self-awareness - even though 95% of people believe they are self-aware. The goal of a 360 is to increase self-awareness about key strengths, blind spots, and the impact a leader has on others. Results identify opportunities to improve. 360s are a foundational step to professional growth and meaningful change. A 360 is not a performance evaluation but is focused on an participantâ€™s development.

## 360 feedback program 

The 360 program is a set of related measures with a specific, long-term focus. Program components include real-time survey analysis, engagement metrics, employee lifecycle, and focus area management techniques. 

A program contains at least one 360 cycle. A program could, however, include cycles focusing on a specific program theme. The number of 360 programs you can set is unlimited.

Viva Glint offers a 360 Feedback program template specifically designed for managers.
