# Preview pre-launch demo data in Viva Glint reporting

How do your employee attributes and potential survey responses look in Microsoft Viva Glint reporting? Previewing demo data enables admins to familiarize themselves with our dashboard, understand how manager hierarchy and employee data file attributes appear in reporting scenarios, and conduct manager training. 

Demo surveys are available for engagement surveys only.

     >[!NOTE]

7. To make changes to your survey once you have previewed how the reporting will appear, select **Edit** from the vertical ellipses next to the program.

## Can I generate a new demo data report preview after editing a survey?

To replace a generated report, preview with newly uploaded employee attributes, a dialog box tells you that a report preview has previously been generated. To replace this demo report with the new version, select **Generate Report Preview**. The seven-day report visibility will start over with the generation of the new report.

## How do I see my demo report?

From your Viva Glint dashboard:

1. Select **Reports.**
2. Choose the **Demo Data** report.
3. Select any report to review.

>[!TIP]
> To navigate to reports for other existing survey programs, select **Switch Program** from your demo dashboard, select your program, and navigate to **Reports**.
