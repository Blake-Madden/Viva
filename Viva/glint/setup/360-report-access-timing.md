# Create a new 360 cycle

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

Decide whether subjects, coaches, or managers receive access to a subject’s report, and then choose the timing. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-report-access-timing.png"alt-text="Screenshot of the Report Access & Timing section in Competencies & Reporting.":::

If access is turned to **ON**, a dropdown menu lets you choose report access timing:
1.	Immediately - A report access email is sent as soon as the 360 cycle closes for a subject.
2.	1-14 days - A report access email is sent based on the selected number of days after the cycle closes for a subject. 
3.	Manually – An admin releases reports at an individual level or using the bulk report release feature. 

>{!NOTE]
> Changes can be made during a live cycle, but note that changes only apply to reports not yet been released.
