# Integrate Viva Insights into Viva Glint

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This integration is available beginning on April 9, 2024.

Bring Viva Glint feedback scores into Viva Insights to stay on top of Viva Glint data in your everyday dashboard. Send recurring and ad-hoc survey results from Viva Glint feedback to Viva Insights Power BI to connect Copilot usage metrics and uncover insightful information about employee sentiments.

## Understand the use cases for the integration

Two prominent use cases for this data integration:  

- Use the M365 Copilot Impact Survey in Viva Glint to collect feedback from your M365 Copilot users and connect their sentiments with Copilot usage metrics on the Viva Insights Copilot dashboard.  
- Send your employee engagement survey scores to the Viva Insights Power BI template to find behavioral drivers of employee sentiments.  

 ## Prerequisites for the integration

The Viva Glint Global admin permissions Viva Insights to use Viva Glint feedback data prior to integration. This happens in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC).

1. Hover over *Manage data sharing with Glint* to open the slider window.
1. Select **I authorize sharing Insights data with Glint**.
2. Select **Save**.
