# Suggested content for a Viva Glint Distress survey

When societal or global events introduce instability and disruption to our natural patterns in work and personal lives, it causes distress. COVID-19 is an example—it introduced a very personal impact on our core human needs for safety and security. Without addressing fundamental concerns, organizations cannot run “business as usual.”
What do people need at work to remain happy and successful?

People always need these things at work:
•	They want to feel valued and confident about the future of their organization, as well as their place in it. 
•	They want to feel a sense of belonging.
•	They want to feel trust in their leaders.
•	They want to clearly understand how to be their best and do their best work.

During times of distress, they need more. 
People need reassurance that their leaders are prioritizing their safety and wellbeing needs. Employees have a heightened urgency to receive timely, fact-based, and candid communications about what’s happening, why, and the impact on them. They also need the opportunity to express fears and concerns and feel a sense of control over their circumstances. .
During times of change-management, uncertainty, or any overarching factor that brings a feeling of unsettlement and the unknown, consider adding Viva People Science suggested survey items to a scheduled engagement survey or creating an ad hoc distress survey to learn how your people are feeling and what they need.

Instances where a distress survey will benefit your org
Major political, social, hostile, or economic events 
Sudden catastrophic (local or global) natural disaster events
Disease outbreaks and pandemics
Local disasters affecting employee populations or communities
Any other events that cause threat and fear for some of all employees



Choose from three different distress survey options 
When deciding whether to survey, when to do it, and how to position it, consider these options:
•	Engagement Survey – Continue with your existing engagement survey schedule but update it to consider the current environment to receive feedback which helps shape your internal response.

•	Ad Hoc Survey – Deliver an unscheduled survey at a pivotal time when employees need support mechanisms in place and their feedback is essential.
 
•	Always-On Survey – Provide an open channel to allow employees to drop feedback in at any time.
