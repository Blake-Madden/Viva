# Set up Coaching page in Program Summary

The final setup page in Program Summary is the Coaching page. On this page, admins can provide access to coaching assistance for their managers for Team Summary and Team Conversations.

When Team Conversations aren't enabled, admins have only one section to set up:
- **Manager Coaching Content**

When Team Conversations are enabled, admins have two *more* sections to set up:
- **Team Conversation Presentation Guidance**
- **Team Conversation Resource Guidance**
