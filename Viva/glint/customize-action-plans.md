# Customize action plans 

Suggested Action Templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint has included as suggested action items to help managers achieve Focus Areas with their teams. Action Plan templates live in Content Resources within Action Taking on the admin dashboard. 

## Understand terminology associated with action plans 

The following terminology will assist with understanding how Viva Glint determines action plan templates: 

- **Driver**: A factor that affects employee engagement, such as growth or culture. Survey items are developed to surface engagement drivers.
- **Suggested Action Templates**: The overall template associated with a survey item. Managers choose a **Focus Area** via the **Take Action** command within survey results and are then directed to the Suggested Action Template associated with that chosen key driver.
- **Suggested Action Items**: The components of a Suggested Action Template. 
- **Content Resources**: Articles, images, PDFs, and videos that make up Suggested Action Items. 

## Specifications for adding Content Resources 

All content that exists in Content Resources is considered Viva Glint standard content. Content may exist as articles, images, PDF files, or videos. Content must first exist or be added in Content Resources before it can be attached to a Suggested Action Template.

## Adding external links to Content Resources 

1. From the Viva Glint admin dashboard, select Configure and then **Content Resources**. 
1. Select **+ New**. 
1. Select **I Understand**, indicating that you understand that adding a new item adds it for all languages. 
1. Add a title in the Untitled Resource section, select the **Resource Type** from the dropdown box, and add a description. 
1. Follow the on-screen guidance for adding the resource. 
1. Select **Save**. 

## How to clone customized standard content 

Edited content must be renamed before it can be saved and published. This step is referred to as creating a clone so that original content is never altered. In the Shared column, the content indicated as Shared is Viva Glint standard content. In the Last Modified column, standard content will be indicated by *Viva Glint Admin*. New or customized content will be classified as Custom in the Shared column and *Your Name* in the Last Modified column.
