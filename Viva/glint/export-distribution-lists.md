# Export Distribution Lists   

Admins can export Distribution Lists to quickly see the list of employees receiving a survey or the members of a group with specific permissions. This is especially useful for large teams. 

## Manage exports in two ways 

All exports generate a CSV download. Downloads may take a few minutes dependent upon list size. 

### Export survey recipient lists from Program Summary 

This export includes first and last names, email addresses, and employment status.  

1. From your Glint admin dashboard, select the  **Configuration** symbol and then  **Pulse Programs**. 

1. Select the survey for which you would like the recipient list. 

1. On the  **Program Summary** page, choose the  **Distribution** page.  

1. Select  **Download Recipients**. 

1. Choose whether to include all user attributes and User Roles. 

1. Select  **Export**. 

### Export Distribution Lists from the admin dashboard 

Distribution Lists are dynamic; the targeted population may change until the survey is sent. Any list exported after the survey is sent is an actual recipient list.  

Distribution List files will include first and last name, email address, and employment status. 

1. From your Glint admin dashboard, select the  **Configuration**  symbol and then  **Distribution Lists**. 

1. Select the list to be exported. 

1. From the  **All Members**  page, choose the  **Export**  button. 

1. Choose whether to include all user attributes and User Roles. 

1. Select  **Export**.
