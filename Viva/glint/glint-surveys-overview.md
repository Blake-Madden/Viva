# Viva Glint survey types overview

Viva Glint believes that ongoing, frequent communications to solicit and collect employee feedback is crucial to any organization’s success. Viva Glint offers engagement programs as a way for customers to send short, targeted surveys to their employees, which deliver rich insights that translate into actionable opportunities to improve business.

Engagement is the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Engagement correlates with job satisfaction, commitment, involvement, motivation, and attrition.

In addition to **Engagement survey programs**, Viva Glint customers can opt into **Employee Lifecycle survey programs**, and **360 Feedback programs.**

Our People Science team regularly updates the survey items and develops templates that provide meaningful insights into the current world of work.

## Details of the surveys

Within our survey programs, there are two overarching types to consider:

- **Organizational survey** – often administered by a global HR (Human Resources) team and sent to all employees on a recurring cadence.
- **Business unit survey** – often administered by a core business team, HR team, or a local business leader with the goal of obtaining more specific information for a particular business unit.

### Recurring surveys

Viva Glint offers seven recurring survey templates in addition to a blank template from which you can create your own survey. Surveys should be *recurring* so that data can be compared from between cycles and *trend* can be established.

### Engagement surveys

Engagement surveys measure drivers that are proven to increase employee happiness at work.

#### Quarterly Engagement survey

Quarterly Engagement survey is Viva Glint’s premier survey, and we suggest that you begin with this survey and plan to run it four times annually. The Quarterly Engagement survey template includes all of Viva Glint’s core engagement items making it an effective survey to determine a solid engagement baseline measure for your organization. The template includes items that all have benchmarks, translations, and action plans along with our recommended cadence and item order. [Refer to this resource to understand the items associated with this template](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/PSTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9D9A33C8-0524-4B49-9375-359243C282DB%7D&file=New%20Quarterly%20Engagement%20Survey%20Template.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&share=IQHIM5qdJAVJS5N1NZJDwoLbAeatTv19PXOo_OXmMDCgm9A).

#### Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging survey

Diversity (the signal that an organization values uniqueness) and inclusion (the expectation and assurance that everyone can take part in organizational life) build the foundation for a powerful sense of belonging. Employees with a keen sense of belonging are more likely to be engaged. Use this template to understand how your employees feel about their sense of belonging. [To know more, see People Science explaining Viva Glint’s DIBs (Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging) philosophy](https://community.glintinc.com/organizational-behavioral-science-56/diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-people-science-explained-1035).

#### Culture survey

Organizational culture influences how decisions get made, how people behave, shape experiences, and determine how work gets done. It's important to measure your organization’s culture because culture is a group phenomenon. This template provides greater understanding of the many cultures that can exist within an organization.  

#### Manager Effectiveness survey

Effective managers help their teams feel supported, inspired, and committed to the company vision. Manager Effectiveness surveys collect feedback at important developmental stages and provide clear insight to identify your manager’s effectiveness and suggested opportunities for improvement.

#### Patient Safety survey

For healthcare organizations looking to assess culture of patient safety in a valid, reliable, and straightforward way. This survey is the shortest and easiest-to-use Leapfrog-approved survey currently available in healthcare.

#### Team Effectiveness survey

Designed to encourage ongoing feedback and sustainable improvement, the Team Effectiveness survey template helps leaders identify each team’s unique dynamics and opportunities for improvement. It can then deliver customized action plan content ensuring the teams can take immediate action to improve effectiveness. Results can be linked to other measurements the organization gathers from Viva Glint programs.

### Ad Hoc surveys

Viva Glint uses Ad Hoc surveys to measure something out of the ordinary. A blank template is available if you choose to create your own ad-hoc survey.

#### Distress survey

Employees need to be reassured that their organization and leaders are prioritizing their safety and needs and required to receive timely, fact-based, and candid communications about what is happening, why, and the impacts it has. Conversely, they need to express concerns and exert control wherever possible to protect against uncertainty. [To know more, see People Science explaining distress surveys](https://community.glintinc.com/survey-science-55/distress-surveys-people-science-explained-1021).

### Always-On Feedback

Use this survey type to allow you and your team to provide feedback and suggestions anytime it feels relevant. A blank survey can be created for Always-On Feedback, as well.

#### Always-On Distress survey

This survey is similar to the Distress survey mentioned earlier but available whenever you or an employee wants to use it.

### Employee Lifecycle surveys

Employee Lifecycle surveys are used to measure the employee experience during key moments in the employee journey. Employee Lifecycle dates are automatically triggered based on an event date. Our two standard Employee Lifecycle templates are for **Onboarding** and **Exiting** employees.

#### Onboarding survey

With new hires, there's a unique opportunity to direct their excitement and curiosity to sustainable, positive outcomes. By checking in with them often and course correcting as needed, businesses can ensure initial excitement is used to sustain continued engagement and performance.  [For more information, see People Science explaining the importance of onboarding](https://community.glintinc.com/people-science-library-21/creating-a-people-centric-organization-starts-with-onboarding-pdf-1000).

#### Exit survey

Exit surveys are the first step to helping organizations understand why people leave, the experience they had as they left, and even what they might be willing to do for the organization after departing. Past employees can be a brand ambassador or could also tarnish a business’s reputation through negative feedback and reviews. [See People Science explaining why the Exit experience matters](https://community.glintinc.com/organizational-behavioral-science-56/exit-experience-why-it-matters-people-science-explained-1005).

### 360 Feedback programs

#### Manager 360 Feedback program

These surveys support the development of leaders, managers, or other selected employees. Your employees can request to be the subject of a survey and select their own raters. [For more information, see People Science explaining the use of 360 Feedback](https://community.glintinc.com/people-science-library-21/glint-people-science-explained-360-feedback-1012).
