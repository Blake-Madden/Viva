# Managers using the Team Summary dashboard 

The Team Summary manager dashboard experience displays results from the most recently closed program. You can choose to see results from previous programs as well. 

The following guide describes each section in the manager dashboard. 

## Understand the survey title card 

The title section includes:
- The current survey title that you have chosen 
- The date the survey closed or is closing on - for Recurring and Ad-Hoc surveys 
- Viewing window - for Employee Lifecycle and Always-On surveys 
- Settings button – for filtering comparison and outcome items 
- Switch Program button – for changing to view another completed program

## Manager Concierge visibility

The following four steps your manager will see are:
1. Step 1 – Give feedback 
1. Step 2 – Interpret results 
1. Step 3 – Discuss with your team 
1. Step 4 – Commit to next steps 

## What else will your manager see on their dashboard? 

The manager dashboard defaults to showing the results from the most recent survey program. Switch to another program by using the **Switch Program** drop-down menu.

### Key driver

Under the survey name, the key driver question will appear, for example, *How is my team doing overall?*
