# Viva Glint Do-it-yourself Insights Review template

## What is the Do-it-yourself Insights Review template for?

Use the Viva Glint platform live when presenting results to your leaders whenever possible. If you do need to create a presentation, this deck guides you through the process and helps identify and summarize key insights.

## Think like a Viva Glint Science Consultant

Read the guidance on slides 3 and 4  to construct the best presentation for your organization.

> [!TIP]
> Yellow boxes on each slide provide guidance as you put the deck together. *Delete the yellow boxes prior to sharing the presentation!*

> [!TIP]
> Use the desktop PowerPoint app rather than the PowerPoint web browser for a better editing and viewing experience.

> [!TIP]
> If manually entering data into your deck, double check all of your numbers! Our sample slides include data showing where to insert your results. Confirm everything is accurate. It sometimes helps to have another set of eyes confirm the data. 

## Make a great executive presentation

A great executive presentation is short and tells a focused story. The presentation leads to rich conversation and action taking rather than an exhaustive review of data and figures. 

### Best practice method

Review one to two areas of focus only, then move swiftly to action taking with accountability, ownership, and next steps defined.

Use the ACT framework to outline your presentation:

#### Acknowledge

- Present a high-level overview of your results and then going into key themes, which are usually a deep dive on opportunities to improve. We suggest showing no more than 1-2 opportunities from your survey. 

- For each survey theme, use 1-2 slides to help tell your story. Pairing quantitative data (e.g. item scores, heatmaps or alerts) with comment examples will bring your story to life. 

- Consider using external comparisons. Visit Viva Glint's blog to incorporate aggregate data into your presentation. The recurring Viva Glint Employee Well-Being report is a great source of insightful and timely information. 

Rather than relying on this PowerPoint deck for your conversation, we suggest only having a few slides and then going live into the platform to uncover insights live with your group.

> [!TIP]
> Save reports for specific survey items with filters applied right in the platform, so you are ready to go! 

#### Collaborate

- Facilitate a conversation around selecting one area to focus on as a group.

#### Take one step forward

- During this section, the facilitator should assign next steps, roles, and responsibilities.
