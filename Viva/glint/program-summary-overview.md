# Set up Program Summary pages for a survey

The first step for setting up a Microsoft Viva Glint program is to set up **Program Summary**.

## Access Program Summary to set up a new survey

If you need help with choosing a survey, [learn about survey types here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231202). The Project Workbook will help you choose the survey program that provides the best feedback for your organizational goals.

1. From your admin dashboard, select the **Configure** symbol.
2. In the Survey section, choose **Survey Programs**.
3. Select **+ New Program.**
4. Choose your survey template or start from scratch with a blank template.
5. On that card, select **Create Program**.

## Program Summary setup

In the Program Summary section, there can be up to seven pages to be set up. Not all pages are needed for all programs. Only programs necessary for the program you have chosen will be available. Pages for setup can be:

- Program setup
- Distribution
- Schedule
- Reporting
- Questions
- Communications
- Coaching

A checkmark indicates that the page is set up correctly and allows you to move to the next page. If you'd like to move ahead before finishing a page, you need to add dummy data to a page â€“ don't forget to come back and change that to accurate information!
