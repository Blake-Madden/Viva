# Communicate with Nudges

Microsoft Viva Glint Nudges is a system of intelligent, personalized email notifications designed to meet managers where they are in their flow of work. Nudges encourage managers to take simple steps to drive their team’s engagement and performance. Nudge notifications can include a link to the manager dashboard.

Who receives a Nudge is setup at the user role level. You are also able to determine which Nudges each user role will receive.
 
Nudges has filters to ensure they are only sent when relevant. If a user repeatedly does not open or interact with Nudge emails, they are automatically unsubscribed. 

## Nudges are sent on a recurring schedule

Recurring communications keep employees on track over time. Managers receive unique messages with each Nudge to keep the experience fresh, focused, and relevant. Nudges simplify key behaviors into lightweight, bite-sized steps and make action taking collaborative.

Notifications that survey results are ready for viewing are not sent to managers of small teams or to managers who didn’t receive enough feedback to meet confidentiality thresholds. 

If a user is in multiple recipient groups, they may receive emails from either group depending on the cadence of each group and its next send date. Users are guaranteed to never receive more than one email per week.
