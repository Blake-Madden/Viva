# Privacy policy requirement for every Microsoft Viva Glint program

It's the responsibility of the Viva Glint program admin to be sure a privacy policy is available for all users of Microsoft Viva Glint programs, both while taking surveys and when viewing their Viva Glint dashboard. Choose from one of these two options:

- Use your company’s privacy policy.
- Use Microsoft’s Privacy Statement by default.

## Use your company’s privacy policy in Viva Glint programs

The setup for the privacy policy is self-serve from the admin dashboard.

### To add your company’s privacy policy

Follow this procedure:

1. From the admin dashboard, navigate to **General Settings** and then **Company Information**.
2. Add the link to your company’s privacy policy URL in the bar in the *Company Privacy Policy* section.

Your company’s privacy policy link will now be embedded as a hyperlink on Viva Glint’s top navigation menu bar, survey header, and survey introduction page. If you haven't provided a correct link, an error message directs you to enter a valid URL.

>[!NOTE]
> Microsoft’s privacy statement is always displayed on email communications and program login pages.

### To access your Company’s Privacy Statement

If admin choose to insert the link to your company’s privacy statement, employees can access it in these places:

1. **Survey page:** survey takers can access it from the **‘privacy policy’** hyperlink on survey intro page or by selecting the **question mark** symbol on survey top navigation bar and then **Privacy** from the dropdown menu.  
2. **Glint website navigation bar:** From the top navigation bar of Glint website, select the **question mark** symbol and then **Privacy** from the dropdown menu to view the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

>[!NOTE]
> Microsoft's privacy statement will display in all Viva Glint email footers and login screens.

## To use the Microsoft Privacy Statement

If an admin doesn't insert the link to your company’s privacy statement, the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) link displays as the default privacy statement in every location a policy is expected. 

>[!NOTE]
> Microsoft's privacy statement will display in all Viva Glint email footers and login screens.

## To summarize: Where will employees have access to a privacy policy?

Privacy policies are accessible from:

- Viva Glint email footers and login screen  
- The Viva Glint survey header
- The Viva Glint survey intro page
- The question mark symbol on Viva Glint’s top navigation menu
