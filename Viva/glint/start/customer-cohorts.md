# Viva Glint customer cohorts

We have kicked off our Viva Glint Cohort program! Whether you are a customer new to Viva Glint or migrated to Viva Glint – all are welcome! 

The purpose of this program is to foster a collaborative learning environment where you can share knowledge, experiences, and challenges with other Viva users of a shared interest.  These opportunities will help you learn how other companies like you are developing their listening programs and how they are using Viva to solve organizational and industry challenges. We have created an online space for you to collaborate, and once a quarter, the Viva Glint cohort team will be hosting a virtual session dedicated to things like relevant topics, Q&As, open discussions, you name it!  

## Sign up now!
