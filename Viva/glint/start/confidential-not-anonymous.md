# Why Viva Glint surveys are confidential rather than anonymous

## Microsoft Viva Glint surveys are confidential, not anonymous

Survey results that are aggregated (grouped) but not anonymized, can automatically link data across multiple surveys and programs to provide customers with cross-program intelligence. If the data were anonymous, analytical capability would be severely limited.  

To protect confidentiality and allow cross-program intelligence, survey responses are linked to an individual by a randomly generated survey ID, while all reporting hides the individual's identity. All reporting is done in aggregate and no data is revealed at the individual level. Microsoft Vivaâ€™s default respondent confidentiality threshold is five for data (scalar items) and 10 for comments, but these thresholds can even be increased.

Viva Glint also makes available an optional GDPR tool for individual data anonymization. A customer can use this data masking upon request to replace data value fields completely and permanently with dashes. This tool has its best use case scenario with former employees (also called leavers), or data subjects who exercise their right to be forgotten (also known as right to erasure). It isn't used for anonymizing all the customer's historical survey data.   

## Why use data masking over an anonymized survey 

Optional anonymization allows our customers to satisfy their analytics requirements while meeting regulatory requirements, whereas anonymous surveys will likely impact reporting and analytics.
