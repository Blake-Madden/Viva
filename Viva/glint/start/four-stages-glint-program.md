# Four stages of a Viva Glint program

The article walks you through the four stages of a Microsoft Viva Glint program. The four stages help you launch the right feedback program to the right people in your organization.

Create a strong feedback program by incorporating these four phases:

- **G**  - **Goals** - Ask questions of your organization to determine how you use feedback to support goals.
- **L**  - **Launch** - Design your program, set up your survey, and set your program live.
- **IN** - **INsight** - Gather and analyze feedback using reporting results.
- **T**  - **Transform**- Implement small, meaningful changes across your company.

## Questions to consider during Viva Glint program phases

Answering the following sets of questions ensures that you're prepared to launch the right survey, to the right people, and that your resulting action-taking is insightful and sustainable. Connect with your leaders for the most effective insights.

### Goals phase

- What is the current focus area for your business?
- What engagement areas have you been focusing on? How do you plan to check in on these areas?
- If this survey isn't your first survey:
  - Have changes or shifts in your business occured since the last survey?
  - Have the goals of your program changed?
  - Are there survey items that you'd like to rotate in or out?

### Launch phase

- When are you going to launch your next survey? What is your planned cadence?
- What other feedback programs might be running simultaneously that may impact this survey?
- What other surveys might impact the timing for this launch?
- If this survey isn't your first survey, how did your communications approach work before? Does anything need to be modified?
- How can you lean on champions to help support our survey efforts?

### INsight phase

- How did you decide what to focus on? Did you use the ACT conversation model? Team Conversations?
- How are results, next steps, and expectations communicated to leaders and managers?
- Can you become more agile with your rollout and platform access strategy?
- How can you continue to bring insights into other key strategic initiatives?
- How did you onboard leaders and managers to Viva Glint? Employees? HR team members?

### Transform phase

- How are you keeping up momentum?
- Which parts of the organization are successful in taking action? How can everyone learn from that group?
- Are leaders transparent about results and committed to action?
- Are managers owning their data?
- Do employees feel empowered to participate and influence change?
- Do HR employees coach leaders and managers to enable change?
