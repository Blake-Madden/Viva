# Viva Glint report access levels

## Choose reporting access level for managers

There are two levels of reporting access you can choose:

- **Live access**: Reporting access is readily available in real time as surveys are completed. Administrators will always have Live access and can't be included in Phased access rollout.
- **Phased access**: Recommended for managers and HRBPs (HR Business Partners) for action planning, tracking, and reviewing feedback results for *completed* surveys, excluding this role group from real-time, live survey results. Phased access is configured at the program level but occurs at the cycle level.

  >[!TIP]
  > Keep survey results classified while the survey is Live, among just a small group of leaders. Incomplete results may lead to unintended and inaccurate conclusions. *Feedback results aren't final until all results have been considered.*

## Change from *live* to *phased* access

1. Switch to the **Completed** view and hover over the survey cycle.
2. Select the content in the **Reporting Access** column in that row.
3. The **Program Summary** page will display along with Reporting status.
4. Select **Grant Access**.
5. In **Grant Report Access**, check the box of the roles you wish to grant access to. Once access is granted, it can't be revoked.
6. Select **Provide Access**. The message *Visible to All Reporting Roles and Release Completed* confirms the change.

Once the next program cycle begins, and if the last cycle has Phased access, the access will default back to Live.
