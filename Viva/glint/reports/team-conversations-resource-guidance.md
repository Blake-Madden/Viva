# Set up resource guidance for managers using Team Conversations

## Add resources to the Team Conversations kit 

Enable or disable guidance by switching to **Om** or **Off**. Enabling guidance allows you to select a Content Resource from the dropdown menu. Guidance is specific to the process of conversations and doesn't correlate with the specific Focus Area a manager and their team choose. 

>[!NOTE] 
> View Content Resources already suggested for this kit by navigating from your dashboard to Content Resources. You may add your own resources as well. All suggested Content Resources and added resources appear in the dropdown menu and can be added to the presentation kit.

At any time, or once this page is entirely set up, select **Preview** to see a manager's view. The presentation includes: 

- Slide names (on the left) for navigation 
- A personal note to your manager 
- Best Practices & Tips (resources) you have selected. 

Select **Get Started** to begin the presentation. 

Select **Read More** in Best Practices & Tips to ensure that you have chosen the resource that will best assist your managers. Edit your presentation, as necessary.
