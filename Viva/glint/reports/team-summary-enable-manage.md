# Set up and manage the Team Summary dashboard 

## Enable Team Summary as the default dashboard

1. From the Viva Glint dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs**.  

1. Select the survey.  

1. In **Program Summary**, select **Reporting**. 

1. In **Program Roles**, open the role section by selecting the down arrow on the right.

1. In **Default Dashboard**, use the dropdown menu to select **Team Summary**.  

1. Select **Save Changes**. 

## Add roles to Team Summary 

If a program is approved in **Program Summary**, the **Approved** status must be changed to **NO** to add roles. 

1. From the dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Pulse Programs**.  

1. Select the survey.  

1. In **Program Summary**, select **Reporting**.  

1. Select **Add Role**. From the dropdown menu, select the new role title. The new role is added to the **Program Roles** section, and you can enable Team Summary for the new role as per the procedure above.  

1. Select **Save Changes**. 

## Preview the Team Summary manager dashboard  

Admins can view how potential survey responses will look in Viva Glint before their employees take a survey. This enables company and program admins to familiarize themselves with our dashboard, understand how their manager hierarchy and user file attributes appear in different reporting scenarios, and conduct manager training.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Demo surveys are available for Engagement surveys only.

Prepare to train your manager to use their Team Summary dashboard results by previewing what they'll see. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To preview demo data, Question Targeting, Nudges, and Team Conversations must be temporarily disabled.

### Procedure

1. From the Glint dashboard, select **Configure** and then **User Roles**. 
1. Select the survey from the Upcoming and Live section on the Program Summary page. 
1. Select **Preview** from the vertical ellipses next to the program. 
1. Select **Generate Report Preview** to view a one-time, randomized data report. An email will let you know when the report is available; the report may take up to 24 hours to generate. The report will remain visible for seven days. 
1. Until you receive your email, ensure that your survey program remains in an Approved status. Your report will not generate successfully if your survey program is not Approved.
1. To make changes to your survey once you have previewed how the reporting will appear, select **Edit** from the vertical ellipses next to the program.
1. Choose **Demo Data Report**. Select the report to review.

>[!TIP]
>To navigate to reports for other existing programs, select Switch Program from your demo dashboard. Then select the program and navigate to Reports.

Can I generate a new demo data report preview after editing a survey?

To replace a generated report with newly uploaded employee attributes, use the dialog box indicating that a report preview has previously been generated. To replace the demo report with the updated version, select **Generate Report Preview**. The seven-day report visibility will start over with the generation of the new report.
