# Use the Viva Glint Heat Map Report

The Microsoft Viva Glint Heat Map Report identifies high and low scoring teams on engagement and other key drivers and can be filtered by attributes within your Glint Employee Data File.

The Heat Map Report is useful for HRBPs, admins, or any senior leader who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons.

## What does the Heat Map Report show?

 >[!NOTE]
> Heat Map results are only available when confidentiality thresholds are met.

Heat maps are sorted so that it’s easy to find patterns. The rows at the top typically tend to have higher scores across the majority of teams, while the columns on the left represent teams with lower scores across the majority of drivers. Heat Maps are interactive and display scores for each question broken down by demographic attributes – (for example: team, location, or tenure). Use Heat maps to quickly and easily spot patterns and outliers.

>[!NOTE]
> Colors only indicate high and low scores relative to the median score in the Heat Map.

## Using the Heat Map Report

Select the **Reports** tab on your admin dashboard and then the **Heat Map Report** card. 

The heat map display defaults to show your team.

For any population you are reporting on, the highest score is in the darkest blue, while the lowest score is in the darkest red. The other scores are plotted in the heat map in various shades of blues and red relative to the highest and lowest scores.

You can also configure your view of the data in the heat maps by expanding the bar and changing your selections.  You might want to include the changes since the last pulse, for example, in addition to the current score.  To do this, you can choose to show “Scores and Changes” instead of just the scores.  You could also add in the Benchmark comparison to look at your scores vs the Benchmark. To understand more about benchmarks, watch the short video on Benchmarks.

Heat Maps can be generated for any of the attributes for which you have permission.  We can change the view to the Location attribute, for example. You can also search for specific departments or business areas by typing in a group such as “Services” or “Sales” to see their specific Heat map. For easier or preferred viewing, there are additional Heat Map features to sort or move the data around.

By clicking “Sort” you have options to sort the questions or departments alphabetically, by score, or by size.  You can also click on the carets next to any question or group in order to rearrange their location in the list.

You can click on any of the cells to drill down into that particular driver and team.  

Like many of the other Glint Reports, you’re able to click and dive deeper into the data. In this report, you can click into a cell and dive deeper into specific question data, team data, or any other slice of the data you’ve configured your report to view.

This report is extremely helpful to identify hot spots or low scores, and bright spots or areas to celebrate, as well as outliers.

To improve report visualization for large customers, the number of columns that show will now be capped at 150. If your organization uses more than 150 columns, a message will indicate that the onscreen results will only display 150 columns. To see the full results, users can export the report to a spreadsheet or use onscreen filters to focus in on certain groups.

Relative Coloring

Color coding for the Heat Map report

The colors in the Heat Map are meant to allow quick identification of systemic patterns and outliers. Color coding is relative and not absolute. To determine the relative coloring within a Heat Map, Viva Glint looks at the range of scores displayed.

The maximum and minimum are always displayed as dark blue and dark red.
All scores between the maximum and minimum are evenly bucketed in up to seven different colored buckets, with the median score being shown in the gray middle bucket.
For example: If the minimum and maximum scores are 52 and 80, then Viva Glint will create 7 evenly spaced buckets between 52 and 80.
Dark red would be 52-55
Dark blue would be 77-80
Gray would be 64-68 with the other shades being in between (For changes and differences, the middle gray is used for 0 change or difference. Dark red is used for the biggest negative difference/change, and dark blue for the biggest positive change, and the other color buckets are evenly spaced between the maximum/minimum values and 0 on either side.)
