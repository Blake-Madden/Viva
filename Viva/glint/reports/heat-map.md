# Use the Viva Glint Heat Map Report

The Microsoft Viva Glint Heat Map Report identifies high and low scoring teams on engagement and other key drivers and can be filtered by attributes within your Glint Employee Data File.

The Heat Map Report is useful for HRBPs, admins, or any senior leader who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons.
