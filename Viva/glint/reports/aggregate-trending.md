# Viva Glint aggregate groupings - trends and best practices

## Understand aggregate trending
Aggregate trending supplies historical data over time. There's a trend point, which reflects matching items from one cycle to the cycle immediately preceding it. Changing items within an aggregate (group) interrupts trend.

## Viva Glint aggregate trending terminology
|**Term**| **Definition**|
|-----------|-----------|
|Aggregate | A grouping of two or more items that measure a concept within a survey|
|Aggregate score | The average score of all the items divided by that number of items|
|Trend | Any difference in the score of a single item from one cycle to the previous cycle |
|Aggregate trend | Any difference in the combined score from one cycle to the previous cycle. Aggregate trend exists only when all items in two consecutive cycles are identical. |

>[!TIP]
> We recommend that aggregate groupings are not used in surveys.

### Aggregate grouping can lead to unreliable aggregate trend 

Why not to use aggregate groupings in surveys: 

- Surveying more frequently with fewer individual questions produce more useful, focused results. 
- Single-item measures are better than multiple-item measures when it comes to utility and reliability. They can predict future behavioral outcomes, and they can do it consistently over time. 
- A multiple-question group (aggregate) may limit the intervention opportunities for a single item within that group. That one item can become lost inside the group of items. 
- Action should only be taken at the single item level. Focusing managers on aggregate scores doesn’t help enable action. 

>[!CAUTION]
> Trend is considered unreliable when it is not measuring “apples to apples” - when there are differences in the items that appear in an aggregate between the new cycle and the same aggregate in the previous cycle. Trend will be shown when at least one item is identical in the same aggregate in two cycles, but unless all items are identical, the aggregate trend is not measuring a consistent group of items and is not as reliable as single item trend data.
