Viva Glint admins can manage Focus Area periods directly from the platform. A Focus Area period is the timeframe (or window) from the time the Focus Area is created through when action taking should be completed.

Managing Focus Area periods allow admins to determine how often to survey based on the needs of their organization, such as quarterly or by fiscal year. From the Configuration page, users with permissions will see a Focus Areas section with an option for managing Focus Area periods. 

Pushpin. Note: Users need Manage Focus Area Periods permission to configure this feature. Set that up within User Roles from your Glint dashboard.

Details
To create and edit Focus Area periods, follow this procedure:

From the Focus Areas section on the admin dashboard, select Periods.

Select + New Period to open the Create Period slider window.
Select a language. Each language will save as they are selected.
Select a cadence: monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, weekly.
Name the period.
Choose a start date. See below.
Choose an end date. The end date is the date that all actions are expected to be completed by. Managers will see this due date on their action plan. See below.
Enable the Focus Area period.
Save Changes.
Focus Area Periods have a built-in 90-day logic.
Every time a user/manager creates a Focus Area, the system will verify if there is a current Focus Area period with at least 90 days left from the Focus Area due date. If not, Glint system will create a new annual Focus Area period. This new annual Focus Area period will be the default to allow users enough time to complete all actions.

So when configuring this window, realize that action Plan strategies are built around a 90-day completion plan. Create the time period to allow 90 days from the day the manager will establish their action(s) through the due date (90 days thereafter).
