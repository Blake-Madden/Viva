# Post-survey coaching for managers of small teams

Survey results in the Microsoft Viva Glint platform are available to managers as soon as one day after the survey closes [Read about Live versus Phased access](/../../viva/glint/setup/live-versus-phased-access). Hopefully your managers are eager to see their results, as are their employees. However, due to confidentiality thresholds set in the Viva Glint platform, some views of feedback results may not display data. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint admin sets the confidentiality threshold in the Reporting section of General Settings. [Read about setting up the Reporting section](/../../viva/glint/setup/manage-general-settings).

Managers can still have great feedback sessions with your team. Here's how: 

## Enable Broader Team Insights for your managers 

Managers of small teams may not have enough team members with overall size or response rate size to view their own team’s survey responses. Viva Glint considers this number to be a team of five or less respondents. While it's critical to protect survey respondents’ confidentiality, it's also critical to empower small team managers with feedback and action-taking capabilities. Broader Team Insights (BTI) helps to bridge that gap.

[Follow this guidance to enable Broader Team Insights for your managers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231012)

## BTI allows managers with fewer than five respondents to hold feedback conversations 

> [!TIP]
> Typically the minimum response threshold in your Viva Glint platform should be set to five (5) or more respondents to protect employee confidentiali

Each team’s data rolls up into the next level, so each team is represented in their direct manager’s report. While your managers should have this summary as part of your ACT Conversation, Viva Glint recommends giving managers access to Broader Team Insights as a starting point for their own ACT Conversation. They will download the presentation kit through the prompt at the top of their Viva Glint dashboard when BTI is enabled. 

Review those results. Use the [Manager Quick Guide to Interpretation](https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/viva/glint/Microsoft-Viva-Glint-manager-quick-guide.pdf) to prepare for your conversation.

Managers of small teams can hold their ACT Conversation to discuss where the larger-group results do and might not reflect their smaller-group experience and what action the team will commit to in order to makeimprovements. 

## Managers can fall short of the respondent requirements for a number of reasons

- **Some leaders might have enough respondents in their overall hierarchy to generate a report, but not enough respondents who report into them directly** 

> For example, a leader who has four (4) direct reports, and then each of those directs have six (6) direct reports - Let’s say this leader had 100% participation across their larger team. 
    With 28 responses, they'll receive a report but will not be able to filter that report to only see their four (4) direct reports’ responses, since there are less than 5.

- **A manager may have a team of more than five (5) employees but not all of them might answer the survey or all of the survey items**

> For example, perhaps the team has 14 employees. If only four (4) of those employees answer the survey **or** only four (4) respond to a certain item, no data will be shown.

In these cases, the leader should still have an ACT Conversation with their direct reports using roll-up results. Throughout the Acknowledge part of the conversation, the manager should talk to the team about which results might be pertinent to their smaller team or smaller group of respondents.

## Conversations are meaningful even if they do not refer directly to a manager's own team's results

The goal of survey feedback is to understand what most engages and inspires a team to be their best at work. Survey scores are a starting point for a conversation that involve a team in identifying actions that can be taken to improve engagement. Even just a few responses - or limited views of results - can make effective use of available BTI data and foster a rich team conversation. 

## Small teams may seem less likely to need survey results but this theory is incorrect

Because they can easily and regularly connect with their team members to know how everyone is doing, it might seem that survey results may not give managers of small teams new information. Also, keep in mind that 5-10 data points is very small from a statistical standpoint because it is more susceptible to large swings up or down based on one person coming into or leaving the team. So once you do have enough respondents to generate a report, the conversation is just as critical, if not more, to ensuring you truly understand your team’s engagement.
