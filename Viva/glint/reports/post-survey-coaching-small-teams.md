# Post-survey coaching for managers of small teams

Survey results in the Microsoft Viva Glint platform are available to managers as soon as one day after the survey closes. Managers are eager to see their results, as are their employees. Due to confidentiality thresholds set in the Viva Glint platform, however, some views of feedback results may not display data.

Managers can still have great feedback sessions with your team. Here's how: 

## Enable Broader Team Insights for managers of small teams

Managers of small teams may not have enough team members with overall size or response rate size to view their own team’s survey responses. Viva Glint considers this number to be a team of five or less respondents. While it's critical to protect survey respondents’ confidentiality, it's also critical to empower small team managers with feedback and action-taking capabilities. Broader Team Insights helps to bridge that gap.

[Follow this guidance to enable Broader Team Insights for your managers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231012)

## Data for survey items with fewer than five respondents will not show in reporting

> [!TIP]
> Typically the minimum response threshold in your Viva Glint platform should be set to five (5) or more respondents to protect employee confidentiality.

Your team’s data rolls up into the next level, so your team (and you) are represented in your direct manager’s report. You may get this summary as you participate in your manager’s ACT Conversation, but Viva Glint recommends giving managers access to Broader Team Insights as a starting point for an ACT Conversation. They can do this by downloading the presentation kit through the prompt at the top of their Viva Glint dashboard. 

Review those results. Use the one-page Manager Quick Guide to Interpretation to help you prepare for your conversation.

Then hold your own ACT Conversation to discuss where the larger-group results do and do not reflect the smaller-group experience and what action you will all commit to in order to make improvements. Follow the one-page Quick Guide to Conversations to help you with this conversation.

## Even a larger team can fall short of the respondent threshold

Some leaders might have enough respondents in their overall hierarchy to generate a report, but not enough respondents who report into them directly. For example, we have a leader who has 4 direct reports, and each of them have 6 direct reports. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say this leader had 100% participation across her larger team. With 28 responses, she will definitely receive a report, but she will not be able to filter that report to only see her direct reports’ responses, since there were less than 5.

In this case, the leader should still have an ACT Conversation with her direct reports using the roll-up results. Throughout the Acknowledge part of the conversation, she should ask her team which of the results is most pertinent to their smaller group.

## Have a meaningful conversation even if it does not refer directly to your own team's results

Keep in mind the goal of pulse feedback is to understand what most engages and inspires your team(s) to be their best at work. Your pulse scores are a starting point for a conversation that involves your team in identifying actions that can be taken to improve their engagement. So even if you have just a few responses, or limited views of your results, you can still use the available data to foster a rich conversation with your team(s). And actually, we could argue managers of small teams are the ones who least need survey results! Because they can easily and regularly connect with their team members to know how everyone is doing, survey results don’t often give managers of small teams new information. Also, keep in mind that 5-10 data points is very small from a statistical standpoint because it is more susceptible to large swings up or down based on one person coming into or leaving the team. So once you do have enough respondents to generate a report, the conversation is just as critical, if not more, to ensuring you truly understand your team’s engagement.
