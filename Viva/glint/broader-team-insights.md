description: "Broader Team Insights bridges the confidentiality-driven gap for managers of small teams that may not have enough team members or survey responses to view their own team’s responses."

# Use the Broader Team Insights feature 

Team leaders who use Microsoft Viva Glint’s action taking tools see a significant increase in scores, however, up to 50% of managers’ teams are too small to allow them access results to their own team’s results. By enabling Broader Team Insights, managers are empowered to significantly impact employee engagement.  

Managers of small teams may not have enough team members, in overall size or response rate size - to view their own team’s survey responses. Viva Glint considers this number to be a team of five or five respondents. While it's critical to protect survey respondents’ confidentiality, it's also critical to empower small team managers with feedback and action-taking capabilities. Broader Team Insights helps to bridge that gap. 

Broader Team Insights isn't only limited to managers of small teams. Team leaders at all levels who use Broader Team Insight are better able to anchor their team’s feedback in the context of their larger department, have better conversations, and align actions.

## What does the Broader Team Insight dashboard show?   

The Broader Team Insight dashboard allows managers to review a high-level summary of their direct team leader’s results. For small team managers who don't have access to their own team’s results, this provides: 

- Visibility into their broader team’s opportunity areas 
- Access to dashboard and action-taking capabilities
- Starters for ACT and 1:1 conversations
- Ownership and accountability for their team’s engagement scores
- By enabling bottom-up change, you can create more engaged people, align teams, and promote greater business performance. 

By enabling bottom-up change, you can create more engaged people, align teams, and promote greater business performance.

## How small teams uses Broader Team Insight

When a team’s number of responses fall below the confidentiality threshold, as in the example of Terence’s team of three in the image below, the team manager can't view their own team’s results. With Broader Team Insight, however, the team leader can view the results of their direct leader’s team.

When results are ready, the team manager (Terence, in this example) will receive an email with a link to view results. When selecting this link and landing on their dashboard, a message indicates that while there's no access to their own team’s results (because minimum confidentiality standards weren't met), a summary of broader team’s results are available for reviewing and sharing.

In this Summary report view, Terrence can see customized guidance on how to have a conversation with their own team about the Broader Team Insight results and an abbreviated view of the Executive Summary report.

## How large Teams uses Broader Team Insight

In the following example, Terence’s manager, Kira, does see results for her team. However, with Broader Team Insight, she has an option to view a high-level summary of her own manager’s results, adding her own team’s feedback and scores into the context of her broader team and increasing transparency across the organization. 

## Set up Broader Team Insight

From the admin dashboard, Broader Team Insight is enabled following this procedure: 

1. Select **Pulse Programs**.
1. Select the program name to be enabled. 
1. Select **Reporting**. 

### Set up Program Roles 

The first section in **Reporting** is **Program Roles**. In this section, you customize how your dashboard displays and when your people can view survey results. This section allows setup by specific roles. 

   > [!NOTE]
   >When a manager is in a role with Broader Team Insight enabled, cascaded results are based on their custom permissions, irrespective of their rollup managerial hierarchy.

Decide whether this role’s reports are visible to directs only or are visible to their entire roll-up hierarchy. ON enables sharing of report, OFF disables the role from sharing reports. 

- Use the dropdown menu to assign report visibility to direct report or roll-up hierarchy. 
- The padlock icon symbolizes that this role isn't editable on this page and can only be edited in **Program Setup**.
- Hovering over a role displays the trash can symbol. Select the **trash can** to remove that role.

## How turnover affects what Broader Team Insight results display

Turnover within roles is inevitable. For this reason, as with action taking, we recommend that either HR or the next level up manager exports all feedback results to save and share offline as needed. 
 
*A manager’s feedback won't transfer to a new manager that fills that position*. Feedback is specific to a manager at the time the survey is taken; survey results happen point-in-time, hence, only reflect results (if any) for the current manager in that position.  

## Choose Live vs Phased reports access 

Once a survey is completed, it moves to the Completed section of the Program page, and you can view the access it has been assigned by hovering over the Reporting Access column. For more information, see [Live vs Phased access](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230747).

We recommend that you set a calendar reminder to grant phased access to leaders without live access permissions. 

### How to change access once User Roles are set 

Access can be changed in Program Summary for upcoming cycles and Live cycles. All upcoming surveys for that program will be changed.  

Follow these steps to change the access:

1. In **Program Summary** switch the Approved status from YES to **NO**.
1. Select **Save Changes**, then switch Approved status from NO to **YES**.
