# Propelling Action-taking through conversations - Viva People Science

The likelihood of employee feedback fueling organizational success
hinges on the actions taken based on that feedback. Many companies
build excitement and energy around taking the survey: “We want
to hear from you!” and “Thank you for the feedback!”. However, the
momentum often slows somewhere between “Here’s what we’re going
to do about your feedback!” and what actually gets done to address
issues and make positive incremental changes.

## Compelling data points that reveal why action taking is critical 

We've seen compelling data points that show action taking is critical in our research:

- People who don’t believe action will be taken are 7x more likely to
report being disengaged compared to those who believe action will
be taken.

- Teams where the manager leveraged action planning in the Glint
Platform show 7% increased scores on average relative to the
changes in the company in the areas where the manager took action
within a quarter.

- Teams that score high on action planning are also significantly more
likely to say that they have confidence in the leadership team and are
excited about the future prospects of the company.

- A single quarter is enough for marked and meaningful increases in
scores across teams of varying sizes and initial score levels, when
action is taken by the managers.

- Regardless of the area on which action is taken, there is a high
likelihood that confidence in leadership increases, and this has an
indirect effect on engagement & performance.

## Why isn't action-taking working today?

### Ownership of action is unclear

Everyone agrees that acting on feedback is important. However, oftentimes it’s unclear who is responsible for action taking or the
necessary actions are unequally distributed. 

In some organizations, taking action on engagement results is seen as HR’s responsibility. Glint data shows that employees typically expect
HR and leadership to own the actions that result from survey results, and that’s because, in most organizations, front-line managers don’t
receive results for their teams. If they do receive results, they receive
them weeks, if not months, after HR and executives do. While this
is often viewed as a good practice because it gives each level of
leadership time to synthesize results and prepare responses, it signals
to managers that engagement data is not theirs to own and improve.
As a result, managers often abdicate the responsibility of acting and
communicating actions to leadership and HR. HR teams feel responsible
for addressing all the feedback that has surfaced during an engagement
survey, which can be overwhelming for already stretched teams. Finally,
the limited interaction between senior leadership and employees means
that employees have less visibility into the actions being taken and the
impact those actions have on their day-to-day experience.

Even in organizations that have successfully shifted some ownership to
front-line managers, challenges still exist. Managers often believe that
they bear the entire responsibility of action-taking and that they must
respond to every opportunity surfaced in the results. This is exacerbated
when surveys are long (40 or more items), giving managers hours of
work to comb through results and countless problems to fix. Instead of
feeling empowered, they feel deflated.

### Support and enablement is limited

Managers play a critical role in fostering engagement and learning
within an organization, but many lack the tools and support they need to
contribute effectively to team performance and development. First-time
managers on the front-line manage nearly as much as two-thirds of the
workforce, and over half of these managers don’t get adequate training
to prepare them for these roles.

### Complex action plans are unsustainable

A majority of action-taking processes over-index on planning instead of
actually executing. As the creators of the Agile Manifesto will tell you, it’s
more important to respond to change than follow a plan.
When 80% of action-taking effort is focused on developing long, detailed
action plans, the process feels cumbersome, making it easier to de-
prioritize when other business needs arise. This is especially true when
surveys only occur once per year or every other year. When managers
feel they have 12 or more months to make improvements, they’re more
likely to overplan and overcommit. And it’s quite likely they will lose
momentum before they can actually start to take sustainable action!
Bottom line, action plans are often cumbersome, lengthy, and built in
a silo, and can take months to act upon. Unless people are enabled to
build good and simple habits around sustainable action taking, it’s likely
to run out of steam.

### Feedback can feel hard to act on

Whether giving or receiving feedback, people shy away from being
direct because it feels uncomfortable, especially on teams that might
lack psychological safety. Research shows that feedback which is
perceived as negative doesn’t always result in improvement because
most people want to avoid it. Feedback may feel like a personal attack
when managers see it as a reflection of their abilities and get defensive.
Some will assume it’s their responsibility to fix all the issues while
others may feel like the issues are not under their control and defer the
responsibility. Rather than feeling empowered to make change happen
with their teams, they may end up feeling deflated or helpless.

## Use an agile approach to taking action

In order for actions on feedback to be effective, they must become
integrated into the flow of how we work. We call this “an agile approach”
to engagement. There are 3 key components to making engagement (or
any HR program) evolve to meet the changing needs of today’s world:
People who have the right mindset, skills, and behaviors to support the
shift, Technology that puts the right information at people’s fingertips
with in a simple and delightful way, and a Strategy that aligns with the
priorities and flow of work in a business. Let’s unpack each of these.

### People

It starts with awareness and education about the role everyone plays in
making your organization a great place to work. Show that everyone can
participate in productive conversations about survey results and feel
ownership over action. At a practical level, start by releasing results to
all managers as quickly as possible. It’s critical that all managers are part
of this process so it feels transparent and inclusive. Then, outline clear
expectations for everyone, define prescriptive yet straightforward steps,
and equip your HR teams to coach managers and leaders to embody the
right behaviors. No one person should be solely responsible for creating
an engaged and high-performing workplace.

### Technology

The Glint platform was designed to put meaningful insights into the
hands of managers so teams can move to action. This starts with an
intuitive interface that surfaces key insights based on modern OD
science. Additionally, Glint makes it easy to identify focus areas and
provide guidance on what to do about it through:

- Strengths & Opportunities: a simple and highly actionable summary
of a manager’s strengths and growth opportunities.

- Narrative Intelligence: An award-winning natural language
processing (NLP) engine that surfaces key themes and associated
sentiment from comment data so you can better understand
employee feedback.

- Action items: curated recommendations for actions that can be
taken as well as an extensive resource library for how to improve in
any specific focus area.

- Manager Concierge: An in-platform coach that provides step-by-step
guidance, taking into account the actions a manager has already
taken and making intelligent recommendations for what actions to
take next to help their teams be more successful.

### Strategy

You need a sustainable, and simple strategy to move from one-way
listening to effective action in an organization centered around the
right habits. Start by rethinking how you invest your time. Instead
of improving your listening strategy, shift your focus and develop a
conversation strategy. Help your organization make quality feedback
conversations a habit because it helps managers and teams use data
to fuel action and change behaviors. Here are some key elements of a
simple, agile strategy for taking action:

- Share feedback more frequently; timely, relevant data informs
important business decisions and priorities and allows managers to
build habits through repetition. If they only get feedback once per
year, they have to learn interpretation and conversation skills all over
again every 12+ months

- Reduce the time between feedback and action; get the data out
as soon as possible in the hands of teams so they can get started
working on it.

- Have a laser focus on one impactful shift at a time; don’t focus your
team’s energy on creating long action plans.

- Make adjustments and learn together; evaluate what’s working and
what’s not. Course correct along the way.

- Create a simple check-in process; help teams to collaborate and
hold each other accountable—this can be a 30-minute check-in
when the results first come out and 10 minutes on your monthly
weekly team meeting agenda to keep it alive. The key is to not just
talk about action when a survey comes out.

## Understand that conversations matter

Even the best-laid action taking efforts often lose momentum a few
weeks after survey results are out. After the initial fervor that comes
when new information settles, other priorities take over. It’s not
uncommon for robust action plans to see little progress because there
is no simple mechanism to hold the team accountable for progress. The
missing ingredient to creating sustainable focus on taking action on
feedback is so obvious, it’s often overlooked: Conversations.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/people-science/conversations-matter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the five reasons that conversations matter.":::

### Why do conversations matter?

Research shows that checking in and having conversations in
the workplace are critical to productivity and well-being.Yet, few
organizations have mastered the art of having conversations that are
meaningful and propel progress.

### So what is the problem with conversations?

People give lots of excuses for avoiding important conversations. But at
the heart of it, it’s because:

- It’s not always clear how to facilitate a good conversation, and
therefore the value is unclear.

- Conversations about feedback can feel awkward and/or intimidating.

That’s why we developed the **ACT Conversation Guide**, that serves as
a simple framework for having productive conversations that foster
meaningful connection and continuous improvement. The conversation
framework allows managers and teams to practice the critical steps of a
quality feedback conversation and make it a habit that stays with them.

## Why ACT works

The conversation guide is built on a combination of behavioral science
and practical expertise on what fuels change within organizations. ACT
is fundamentally intended to:

### ACT conversations create trust on teams

By openly sharing and discussing feedback, we improve trust on teams, a crucial building block for creating high
performing teams. ACT inherently requires managers bring their survey
data to the team meeting for open discussion rather than deciding what
the problem and solution is on their own. The conversations prompts
within Acknowledge encourage the manager to bring their hypotheses instead from reviewing the data to the team and work together to identify the
most impactful focus area. Additionally, most of the Collaborate prompts
are written with the intention of maximizing psychological safety on
teams. As research and experience shows, people avoid having difficult
conversations, choosing instead to indulge in counterproductive
behaviors like complaining to others, doing unnecessary work, or getting
angry. Facing these challenges head on can be tough, but can create
psychological safety to have conversations that matter.

### ACT conversations help employees appreciate each other and reinforce the positive

Feedback is a giftand we need to encourage it more often. That’s why in Acknowledge,
we encourage kicking things off by sharing positive stories of progress
you’ve witnessed in the last few months. This will ensure we focus on the
positive in addition to what needs to improve.

### ACT conversations drive focus

We know focus is critical to effectiveness , yet we too
often forget to aggressively prioritize how we take action on feedback.
It’s not uncommon for organizations to become overwhelmed by the
number of issues that arise in their survey feedback and overcommit to
solving everything all at once. The result is that organizational energy
and resources are often diluted and nothing fundamentally changes.
We commonly hear managers say “If we asked the question in a survey,
we have a responsibility to address it.” We don’t believe that to be true.
Employees understand that everyone is busy and resources are limited,
so as long as they can play a part in prioritizing and as long as they see
progress made on one thing, they see that survey feedback is valued.
Additionally, most items in Glint pulses are statistically correlated, which
means that if you improve one item, you are likely to see other items
improve. With Collaborate prompts, we get the teams laser focused
on solving one thing. The use of one in “Take one step forward” is
intentional to keeping team commitments manageable and bite-sized.

### ACT conversations get to the root of the behaviors that help or hinder progress

It’s common for eager teams to tackle a problem by creating a new solution
to address it. With all the right intentions, we add new things to do
without taking anything away. Often, change requires as much undoing
as doing. That’s why in the Collaborate phase, we ask teams to discuss
what behaviors we need to start, stop, continue. It’s especially critical
to talk openly about what we need to stop doing. This is important for 2
reasons: it creates focus and it makes it OK for team members to dissent
and be open and proactive about derailers.

### ACT conversations identify individual commitment

Social theory shows that when you
believe responsibility is diffused, you are less likely to make an effort
to solve it. If you believe improving team morale and engagement is
someone else’s problem, it’s unlikely you will play your part in making
things better. While managers have a clear role to play (see below), each
member on the team can influence the outcome. This is why in Take one
step forward, we encourage individual commitments for progress as well
as a commitment on when to check-in next.

### ACT conversations foster an environment of ongoing learning

Focusing less on achieving a goal and more on ongoing learning creates a growth
mindset where we persist in the face of obstacles, embrace challenges
and seek inspiration from others. The Acknowledge conversation
prompts nudge the team to share what’s working and what’s not
in ongoing check-in meetings. During the Collaborate phase, we
encourage deconstructing what we need to start, stop, and continue
doing to improve outcomes. By transparently surfacing lessons learned,
we can grow together rather than defaulting to fixed mindset triggers
that cause defensiveness. In the Take one step forward teams commit
to when they will check in again, signaling this is not the end of the
conversation.

### Create an agile, continuous improvement mindset

Do you believe engagement can be fixed with a silver bullet solution? Think again. Our
research has shown that the organizations that have an agile approach
to people success are more likely to see business success. At the
heart of an agile approach is that we can’t always get it right the first
time. We must continuously learn from mistakes and iterate. Rather
than over-index on developing a detailed plan, the ACT conversation
guide prompts teams to commit to one simple change over the course
of a few weeks, share lessons learned, and repeat the process. We
love the concept of shifting; shifting doesn’t require you to take on a
monumental change. It’s the alteration of a simple behavior or habit that
everyone can easily make. Here are examples of shifts that could come
out of an ACT Conversation:

- For a recognition focus: Start regular meetings with each team
member recognizing someone else on the team for their support.

- For an empowerment focus: The manager invites the team to come
up with the top 3 things they want him/her to delegate/step out of
and discuss/commit at the next team meeting.

- For a risk-taking focus: At the end of each week, the manager sends
a note out asking team members to respond if they tried something
different this week, and share how it went.

- For a downward communication focus: The manager sends team
3 bullets after each leadership meeting with key points for them to
know.

> [!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint platform has many more ideas of small shifts in the action resources associated with each driver.)

## Are ACT conversations just one more thing we have to do?

No! We know leaders and managers—really all of us—are already too
busy. Creating what feels like a lot of additional work is a recipe for
failure. If we want acting on survey feedback to be integrated into the
“way we do things around here”, here are a couple of common pitfalls to
avoid:

### Making action planning a separate meeting

Creating more meetings is not the answer. In fact, if this is a separate meeting, it’s
likely it will get deprioritized in the face of fire drills and escalations.
We suggest making this part of your regular team meetings. These
check-ins don’t have to be long. They can take up to 30 minutes of
your regular meeting when fresh survey results are out. From then
onwards, it can be a quick 10-15 minute check in on progress to
monitor what’s going well, what’s not going well, and how we need
to shift.

### Work on a problem that’s unrelated to key business activities or that you can’t easily influence

When taking action on feedback feels separate from your business priorities, it is likely to feel
burdensome. That’s why we always recommend that a manager
looks at their data with the lens of “What do we need to accomplish
as a team in the next 3-6 months and what do the pulse results say
about our ability to do that?” By putting feedback in the context of
strategic objectives, we’re not working on something new, we’re
working more effectively on a current priority.

## What is the manager's role?

Driving engagement and performance is a team sport. Leadership
clearly has a role to play in influencing many key drivers such as
Decision-making, Collaboration, Prospects, and Purpose. When these items show up as systemic focus areas, it’s likely senior leadership
needs to own some of the actions given interdependencies to company
strategies, processes, and systems.

But managers play an important role in taking action on feedback for
one simple reason: they are close to the experience on the ground and
can create accountability for teams to make progress. Given this unique
positioning, managers can craft solutions to enhance what matters most
to their people and leverage existing mechanisms to drive progress,
such as team meetings, ongoing one-on-ones, inflight projects, etc.
Managers can use survey feedback to build closer connections amongst
their teams, and increase their participation in making things better.
This ultimately benefits the company and the employees and is more
meaningful than a change in engagement score.

**The role of the manager in the feedback process is not to fix
engagement problems in their silo but to own the ongoing conversations
about taking action that fuel progress.**

More specifically, they need to play the role of:

 - **Coach:**-  Managers must show confidence in the team’s ability and
willingness to solve problems and provide direction to keep the
team on track and avoid going too broad or deep. They also serve
as a role model: if employees see their manager displaying candor,
vulnerability, accountability, and focus, they are more likely to follow.
Finally, managers send a signal about what’s important by what
behaviors they recognize and discuss publicly.

- **Facilitator:** - As a facilitator, managers help teams reach an outcome
that works for the group. Managers can provide guidelines for
prioritization and decision making based on their knowledge of the
organization. As a facilitator, managers should seek out differing
opinions and ensure all voices are heard.

- **Roadblock Remover:** - Taking action can be tough due to
organizational constraints, like company policies, work structures,
budget constraints, etc. Managers are the first-line of escalation to
help overcome these roadblocks and often must navigate larger
organizational structures to help their teams drive change.

**Connector:** - The most important role of the manager is to have
ongoing, meaningful conversations with their team that align with
priorities. Managers can check-in frequently through team meetings,
one-on-ones, etc. to ensure improvements are being made and
course correct when needed. They can also make connections to
other groups that may be working on similar challenges.

## Tips for making ACT work for your organization

- **The first step to building or changing a habit, is wanting to change
the habit!** At Glint we talk about feeling accountable vs. holding
people accountable. When managers feel accountable for improving
engagement, they are much more likely to invest in building
good habits around action taking. It starts with senior leaders role
modeling the right behaviors so managers can be inspired to follow
their example.

- **Integrate it into ongoing processes such as performance
management conversations, stand-up meetings, business reviews,
staff meetings, etc.** We don’t need more meetings!

- **Tell stories.** Reliance on action plans and tracking often manifests
from a desire to demonstrate progress to executives and other
stakeholders. Instead of focusing on activity, focus on impact. A
check-the-box mentality drives superficial change; whereas building
the right habits for effective conversations results in sustainable
improvements. Use stories to talk about how feedback and
conversations made a meaningful difference in the business. Did a
manager use the results to improve team collaboration and deliver
a major product on-time? Did an executive leverage employee
input as a compass to navigate major organizational change? These
stories show greater impact than sharing stats like “30% of managers
viewed results.”

- **Embed these principles - Bite-sized feedback, dialogue and
collaboration between managers and teams, and quick, targeted
action - into other people practices.** This is not just about survey
feedback, it’s what builds quality managers who can lead
engaged teams.

## Summary

Having meaningful conversations that drive connection and focus is hard because
it requires underutilized and under-practiced skills. By providing a simple framework
focused on building the right habits, we can make it repeatable. And repetition will
get us better at the skills and make it easier over time. Once we can build managers’
muscles around feedback and connection, conversations will become habits that
propel action and continuous improvement, without dependencies on HR. This is
when people feel heard and valued, when organizations truly tap into their most
important asset, and when people and organizations thrive.
