# Managers using Viva Glint ACT Conversations

https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/viva/glint/Microsoft-Viva-Glint-manager-quick-guide.pdf

Research shows that checking in and having conversations in the workplace are critical to productivity and well-being. Unfortunately few organizations fully grasp the art of having conversations that are meaningful and propel progress.

So what is the problem with conversations?
People give lots of excuses for avoiding important conversations. But at the heart of it, it’s because:

It’s not always clear how to facilitate a good conversation and therefore the value is unclear.

Conversations about feedback can feel awkward and/or intimidating.

This is the reason Viva People Science developed the ACT Conversation Guide. The ACT Conversation Guide serves as a simple framework for having productive conversations that foster meaningful connection and continuous improvement. The conversation framework allows managers and teams to practice the critical steps of a quality feedback conversation and make it a habit.

Why ACT works
The ACT conversation guide is built on a combination of behavioral science and practical expertise on what fuels change within organizations.

ACT conversations create trust on teams
By openly sharing and discussing feedback, trust improves on teams, a crucial building block for creating high performing teams. ACT inherently requires managers bring their survey data to the team meeting for open discussion, rather than deciding what the problem and solution are on their own. The conversations prompts within Acknowledge encourage the manager to bring their hypotheses instead from reviewing the data to the team and work together to identify the most impactful focus area. Additionally, most of the Collaborate prompts are written with the intention of maximizing psychological safety on teams. People avoid having difficult conversations, choosing instead to indulge in counterproductive behaviors like complaining to others, doing unnecessary work, or getting angry. Facing challenges head on can be tough but can create a feeling of safety to have conversations that matter.

ACT conversations help employees appreciate each other and reinforce the positive
Feedback is a gift and we need to encourage it. **Acknowledge,**tips encourage sharing stories of positive progress in the last few months. This method ensures you focus on the positive in addition to what needs to improve.

ACT conversations drive focus
We know focus is critical to effectiveness. Unfortunately, we often forget to aggressively prioritize how to take action on feedback. It’s not uncommon for organizations to become overwhelmed by the number of issues that arise in their survey feedback and overcommit to solving everything - all at once. The result is that organizational energy and resources are often diluted and nothing fundamentally changes.

We commonly hear managers say “If we asked the question in a survey, we have a responsibility to address it.” We don’t believe that to be true. Employees understand that everyone is busy and that resources are limited. So as long as they play a part in prioritizing and they see progress, they know their feedback is valued. Additionally, most items in Glint surveys are statistically correlated, which means that if you improve one item, you are likely to see other items improve. With Collaborate prompts, teams can laser focus on solving one thing. The use of one in Take one step forward is intentional to keeping team commitments manageable and bite-sized.

ACT conversations get to the root of the behaviors that help or hinder progress
It’s common for eager teams to tackle a problem by creating a new solution to address it. With the right intentions, we add new things to do without taking anything away. Often, change requires as much undoing as doing. In the Collaborate phase, we ask teams to discuss what behaviors we need to start, stop, continue. Talk openly about what we need to stop doing. This method is important for two reasons: it creates focus and it makes it okay for team members to dissent and be open and proactive about derailers.

ACT conversations identify individual commitment
Social theory shows that when you believe responsibility is diffused, you are less likely to make an effort to solve it. If you believe improving team morale and engagement is someone else’s problem, it’s unlikely you're part of making things better. While managers have a clear role to play, each member on the team can influence the outcome. In Take one step forward, we encourage individual commitments for progress and a commitment on when to check-in next.

ACT conversations foster an environment of ongoing learning
Focusing less on achieving a goal and more on ongoing learning creates a growth mindset where we persist in the face of obstacles, embrace challenges and seek inspiration from others. Acknowledge conversation prompts nudge the team to share what’s working and what’s not in ongoing check-in meetings. During the Collaborate phase, we encourage deconstructing what we need to start, stop, and continue doing to improve outcomes. By transparently surfacing lessons learned, we can grow together rather than defaulting to fixed mindset triggers that cause defensiveness. In the Take one step forward phase, teams commit to when they check in again, signaling an initial chat is not the end of the conversation.

Create an agile, continuous improvement mindset
Do you believe engagement can be fixed with a silver bullet solution? Think again. Research shows that organizations that have an agile approach to people success are more likely to see business success. At the heart of an agile approach is that we can’t always get it right the first time. We must continuously learn from mistakes and iterate. Rather than over-focus on developing a detailed plan, the ACT conversation guide prompts teams to commit to one simple change over the course of a few weeks, share lessons learned, and repeat the process.

We love the concept of shifting. Shifting doesn’t require monumental change. It’s the alteration of a simple behavior or habit that everyone can easily make. Here are examples of shifts that could come out of an ACT Conversation:

For a recognition focus: Start regular meetings with each team member recognizing someone else on the team for their support.

For an empowerment focus: The manager invites the team to come up with the top three things they want to delegate and commit to at the next team meeting.

For a risk-taking focus: At the end of each week, the manager sends a note out asking team members to respond if they tried something different this week and share how it went.

For a downward communication focus: The manager sends team three bullet points after each leadership meeting with key points for people to know.

 Note

The Viva Glint platform has many more ideas of small shifts in the action resources associated with each driver.

Are ACT conversations just one more thing we have to do?
No! We know leaders and managers — really all of us — are already too busy. Creating what feels like more work is a recipe for failure. If you want acting on survey feedback to be integrated into the “way we do things around here," avoid these common pitfalls:

Should action planning be a separate meeting?
Creating more meetings is not the answer. Make this topic part of your regular team meetings. Check-ins don’t have to be long. They can take up to 30 minutes of your regular meeting when new survey results are out. From then on, a quick 10-15 minute check on progress to is enough.

Work on a problem that’s unrelated to key business activities or that you can’t easily influence
When taking action on feedback feels separate from your business priorities, it likely feels burdensome. A manager should look at data with the lens of “What do we need to accomplish as a team in the next 3-6 months? What do the survey results say about our ability to do that?" By putting feedback in the context of strategic objectives, working on something new and working effectively becomes a priority.

What is the manager's role?
Driving engagement and performance is a team sport. Leadership has a role to play in influencing many key drivers such as: decision-making, collaboration, prospects, and purpose. When feedback results show up as system-wide focus areas, it’s becomes clear that senior leadership needs to own some of the actions.

Managers play an important role in taking action on feedback because they are close to the experience and create accountability. Given this unique positioning, managers can craft solutions to enhance what matters most to their people and use existing processes to drive progress. Managers can then use survey feedback to build closer connections within their teams and increase participation in making things better. This process benefits the company - and its employees - and is more meaningful than only a change in engagement score.

The role of the manager in the feedback process is not to fix engagement problems in their silo but to own the ongoing conversations about taking action that fuel progress.

More specifically, they need to play the role of:

Coach:- Managers must show confidence in the team’s ability and willingness to solve problems. They should provide direction to keep the team on track and avoid going too broad or too deep. They should act as a role model. If employees see managers displaying candor, vulnerability, accountability, and focus, they are more likely to follow. Managers send a signal about what’s important by what behaviors they recognize and discuss publicly.

Facilitator: - As a facilitator, managers help teams reach an outcome that works for the group. Managers provide guidelines for prioritization and decision making based on their knowledge of the organization. As a facilitator, managers should seek out differing opinions and ensure all voices are heard.

Roadblock Remover: - Taking action can be tough due to organizational constraints. Managers are the first-line of escalation to help overcome roadblocks and often must navigate larger organizational structures to help their teams drive change.

Connector: - The most important role of the manager is to have ongoing, meaningful conversations with their team that align with priorities. Managers can check-in frequently through team meetings, one-on-ones, etc. to ensure improvements are being made, then course correct as needed. Managers can make connections to other groups that may be working on similar challenges.

Tips for making ACT work for your organization
The first step to building or changing a habit, is wanting to change the habit! At Glint we talk about feeling accountable versus holding people accountable. When managers feel accountable for improving engagement, they are much more likely to invest in building good habits around action taking. Start with senior leaders role modeling the right behaviors so managers are inspired to follow their example.

Integrate ACt into ongoing processes such as performance management conversations, stand-up meetings, business reviews, staff meetings, etc. Don’t add more meetings!

Tell stories. Reliance on action plans and tracking often comes from a desire to demonstrate progress to executives and other stakeholders. Instead of focusing on activity, focus on impact. A "check-the-box" mentality drives superficial change. Building the right habits for effective conversations results in sustainable improvements. Use stories to talk about how feedback and conversations made a meaningful difference in the business. Did a manager use the results to improve collaboration and deliver a product on-time? Did an executive use employee input as a compass to navigate major organizational change? These stories show greater impact than sharing stats like “30% of managers viewed results.”

Embed ACT principles - bite-sized feedback, dialogue and collaboration between managers and teams, and quick, targeted action - into other people practices, too. ACT conversations are not just about survey feedback. ACT conversations can build quality managers who can lead engaged teams.

Summary
Having meaningful conversations that drive connection and focus is hard. ACT conversations require skill. By providing a simple framework focused on repeating the right habits, skills are learned. Once manager muscle is built around feedback and connection, conversations become habits that propel action and continuous improvement. And these habits won't be dependent on HR. When this culture embeds itself into an organization, people feel heard and valued, and they can truly thrive.
