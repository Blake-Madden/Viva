# Provider Permissions

You can control access to all catalog and content from a provider so a specific set of user groups can discover the content in Viva Learning.
Content from a provider is discoverable by everyone in your organization, by default. When content is shown to everyone, the access column displays "Public."


> [!NOTE]
> Any changes to permissions - adding, editing, or deleting - can take up to two hours to reflect in Viva Learning.
