# Overview of Language in Viva Learning

Learn how Viva Learning handles language so you can customize the application.

## Introduction

Viva Learning follows international guidelines in language field of all learning content.

The language field has two parts: `ab-CD`  
“ab” represents language as per ISO 639-1 format and “CD” represents locale/country code as per ISO 3166 format.

For example, English used in the United States is shortened as `en-US`.

Language in used in two areas within Viva Learning:

1. **Display language**: The language in the app, including navigation elements and notifications

2. **Content language**: The language of the learning content hosted within Viva Learning

For more information, review the list of Viva Learning [supported languages](/viva/learning/viva-learning-supported-languages).


## Display language

Display language refers to the language in which Viva Learning is accessed. It refers to the language that the navigation names display. This includes **Home**, **My Learning**, and **Manage**, as well as actions like **Share**, **Add to calendar**, and **Rate it**. Notifications in Teams also display in the same language. 

### In the Teams app

When using Viva Learning in Microsoft Teams. Viva Learning display language is set through the Language setting in Microsoft Teams.

Select the three dots on the top right. Then go to **Settings** > **General** > **Language** > **App Language**. 

Update your Microsoft Teams language setting to use Viva Learning in a different Language.

### In the web app

When using Viva Learning in the browser, the Viva Learning display language is set through the **Language** setting in the browser. To use Viva Learning in a different language, update the browser language setting.

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Learning supports 60 languages. Viva Learning may or may not support the Teams or browser language.
> In case the user’s Teams or browser language is not supported, Viva learning falls back to the next related language as per Microsoft Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs guidelines taking language sentiments and sensitivities into consideration.

## Content language

Content language refers to the language of the learning content in Viva Learning.

By default, learning content is loaded in two languages: the [display language](#display-language) and the [default language](/viva/learning/language-preferences/#Default-language).

Learning content is loaded in two languages to avoid the “no learning content” experience. Admins can disable this experience through the [Language preference](/viva/learning/language-preferences/#displaying-content-in-default-and-user-selected-languages) settings.

Learning content in two languages is only visible in the following spaces:

- **Home** page of Viva Learning:
  - **Interests** section
  - **Browse by** section
- **Search result** page and all search modals
- **Assignments** in the **My Learning** tab (Refer to FAQ)
- **Admin** tab
- **Suggestions** in the learning content details view
- **Compose Extension** in Teams Chat
- **Social** tabs in Teams Chat

The following spaces display content only based on user action or preference. They don't show content from two languages.

- **My Learning** tab
  - **Recommendations**
  - **Bookmarks**
  - **In progress**
  - **Collections**
  - **Completed**
- **Trending** section in the **Home** page
- **Manage** tab
- **Share** and **Recommend** actions

## FAQs

- **Why does Viva Learning show English content at all spaces even if my Teams language is not English?**

    By default, Viva Learning shows content from two languages: the display language and **English (US)**(default language).

    If the admin doesn't want this experience, it can be modified in the [Language preference](/viva/learning/language-preferences/#Displaying-content-in-default-and-user-selected-languages) settings.

- **My learning content is available only in language code format (en,fr,es – no country code). How does Viva Learning handle such content?**

    A language with only a language code is called a neutral language. Viva Learning implicitly supports neutral languages in display and default languages.

    For example, if a user is using Viva Learning in Deutsch (Deutschland) – (de-DE), Viva Learning loads all content having language attribute as either (de-DE) or (de).
    
 - **Viva Learning is loading in a different language of my Teams or browser. Is it expected?**
 
    Viva Learning supports [60 languages](/viva/learning/viva-learning-supported-languages). If your teams or browser language isn't supported in this list, Viva Learning falls back to a more suitable supported language as per Microsoft legal guidelines.
    If your teams or browser language is supported but Viva Learning is loading in a wrong language, please create a support ticket.

 - **We are not able to see a specific language content of a provider or LMS.**
    
    Check the documentation of each provider integration to know the supported languages or reach out to the support executive to know the supported languages in each provider or LMS.

- **In which language are assignments shown to users in Viva Learning?**

    The language of assignments is set as follows: **Display language** > **Default Language Setting** (private preview) > **English (US)**
    
    The assignment is loaded in the display language. If the assignment isn't available in display language, then it's loaded in the default language set by the admin in the language preference page. If the assignment isn't available in the admin set default language, then Viva Learning falls back to English (US).  We are working on including Default language in this fallback process.
