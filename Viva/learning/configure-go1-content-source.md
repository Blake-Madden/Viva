8. Your information will display with the Secret hidden. Select the ellipses (**...**), then select **View Secret** to display the Secret.
9. Copy the following values:

    - **Client's Host URL:** This is your Go1 Portal URL. If the Go1 Portal URL is "https://mycompany.mygo1.com", then the Clientâ€™s Host URL will be "mycompany.mygo1.com".
    - **Client ID:** You can find your ID in your Go1 Portal under the **Integrations/Developer** menu options.
    - **Secret:** You can find your Secret in your Go1 Portal under the **Integrations/Developer** menu options.
