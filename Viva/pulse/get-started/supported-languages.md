# Supported languages

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Public Preview program to access it. See [Set up Viva Pulse Public Preview](../setup-admin-access/set-up-viva-pulse-public-preview-for-your-organization.md) to enable the Viva Pulse Public Preview for your organization and enable Teams Activity feed notifications for users in your tenant. Also, please note that customer support will only be available in English for Public Preview. Features are subject to change.

## Languages available in the UI

Viva Pulse is currently available in English only. Support for additional languages is coming soon.

Content added by users (such as when feedback providers enter responses for open-ended questions) is displayed in the language in which it was entered.

For information about supported languages in other Viva applications and services, see [Microsoft Viva language support](/viva/viva-language-support).
