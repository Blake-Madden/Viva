# Enable notifications for your organization

Viva Pulse uses the Teams Activity feed and email to deliver notifications. Users receive Teams and email notifications when a feedback author requests a Pulse, when feedback providers are reminded to respond, when a feedback author is notified their Pulse request has closed, and when a feedback author shares a Pulse report.

## Teams notifications

Users only receive Teams notifications from Viva Pulse if they have the Viva Pulse Teams app installed. As an admin, you can install the Viva Pulse Teams app in your tenant through a [Teams app setup policy](./manage-install-pin-viva-pulse-in-teams-admin-center.md).

If users are not receiving Teams notifications from Viva Pulse, please encourage users to visit the Teams app store to download the Viva Pulse Teams app.

## Email notifications

Users receive email notifications from Viva Pulse. It can take up to 24 hours for email notifications to be delivered to Pulse feedback providers and authors. If email notifications are not delivered within 24 hours, log a support incident or report the issue through our in-app feedback options.
