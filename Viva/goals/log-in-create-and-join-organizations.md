# Log in to Viva Goals and get started with organizations

Logging in to Viva Goals is a simple process for anyone whose business or org has purchased or subscribed to the product. Once you've logged in, you can join or create organizations. Organizations usually represent the highest level of your business hierarchy (that is, the business itself as a whole), but specific departments might have their own organizations in Viva Goals in cases where department autonomy or information compartmentalization is particularly important.

## Log in to Viva Goals

If your organization has purchased or subscribed to Viva Goals, anyone in the organization can log in to Viva Goals using their Microsoft Entra credentials. You don't need to log in if you're already logged in to another Microsoft 365 product or service.

1. Go to the Viva Goals sign-in page at https://goals.microsoft.com/.

1. Use your Microsoft Entra credentials to log in.

1. What happens next will depend on your scenario:

    * If there aren't any existing organizations for you in Viva Goals, you'll be directed to the **No organizations** page and prompted to [create an organization](create-or-join-an-organization.md).

    * If you're a first-time user invited to join your organization via an invite link, you'll be taken directly to your organization's Viva Goals account.

    * If you're logging in for the first time and aren't yet part of an organization, you'll be directed to the **Join Organizations** page to select your organization from a list.

    * If you're a returning user who's already part of an organization, you'll be taken to that organization. <!--Editor's Note: Is this different from the second option in any way other than the context?-->

## Log out of Viva Goals

Logging out of Viva Goals is simple: at the bottom of the left-hand nav, select **Account Settings** > **Log out**.

## Create your first organization

1. [Log in](https://goals.microsoft.com/) to your Viva Goals account using your Microsoft Entra credentials.

1. You'll be prompted to create an organization. Select **Create Organization**.

1. Enter your organization name and a brief description (optional) and select the organization type: **Public** or **Restricted**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A *public* organization is one that anyone in your company can join without needing approval. A *restricted* organization lets you choose which users get to join; restricted organizations are better when you want a tight-knit group of users to maintain information boundaries.

1. Select **Create Organization**.

As the organization administrator, you can now add users to your organization by inviting members.

## Create another organization

If you're a part of more than one organization and need to create another organization in Viva Goals, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your first organization in Viva Goals.

1. Select your organization's name at the top of the left-hand navigation menu.

1. At the bottom of the organization switcher dropdown that appears, select **Create or join organization**.

1. On the **Join organizations** page, hover over **Create new organization** and select **Create Organization**

1. Repeat the steps you followed to create your first organization.

Once you're a member of multiple organizations in Viva Goals, you can use the organization switcher dropdown to switch between different organizations.

## Join an organization

1. Log in to Viva Goals (https://goals.microsoft.com/) using your Microsoft Entra ID.

1. What happens next will depend on your scenario:

    * If you're logging in for the first time and aren't yet a part of any organization, you'll be taken to the **Join organizations** page, where you can select your organization.

    * If you're already a part of an organization, select your organization's name at the top of the left-hand navigation menu, then select **Create or join organization** at the bottom of the resulting organization switcher dropdown. This will take you to the **Join organizations** page.

1. Find the organization you want to join.

    * If your organization is public, you'll see a **Join** button. Select that button to go to your organization's account.

    * If your organization is restricted, you'll see a **Request to join** button. Select that button to send a join request to your organization administrator for approval.
