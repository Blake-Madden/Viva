# Introduction to Copilot in Viva Goals

Microsoft Copilot in Viva Goals lets you leverage next-gen AI to create, share, manage, and summarize your organizational goals quicker and easier than ever. It offers in-app guidance for creating and refining goals, providing a productivity boost to users regardless of their familiarity with whatever goals framework their team follows.

## Prerequisites

During the preview, the Copilot feature in Viva Goals will be disabled by default. Before anyone in an organization can use Copilot in Viva Goals, that org's tenant admins must enable Copilot from the Admin portal. Tenant admins have complete control over the rollout of Copilot in Viva Goals within their org. They can also decide which users or security groups are allowed to access Copilot. Tenant admins can access these and other Copilot admin settings by selecting the Viva Goals admin center icon in the top header and scrolling to *Who can see Viva Goals Copilot in TENANT NAME?* under the **General** tab.
