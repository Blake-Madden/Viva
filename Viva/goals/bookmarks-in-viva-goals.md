# Bookmarks 

You can bookmark users and teams in Viva Goals to access their Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and other activities without having to browse through all users and teams.

To bookmark a user, go to **All users** and search for the user. Then, select the "bookmark" symbol.

To bookmark a team, go to **All teams** and follow the same steps.

To access any bookmarked user or team, select **bookmarks** from the left navigation menu.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Bookmarks** option only appears in the menu if you have items bookmarked.
