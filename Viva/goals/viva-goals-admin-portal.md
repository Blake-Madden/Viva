### General

- [Configure who can create organizations](restrict-organization-creation-permissions.md)
- Approve domains to be embedded in dashboards

### Integrations

- [Configure integrations](vg-integrations-administration-overview.md) available for all Viva Goals organizations in the tenant

### Manage organizations

As a Viva Goals administrator, you can view the list of all organizations from the **Organizations** tab. Select a record to view the organization information, such as the owner, admins, join access, number of teams, and members in the organization. <!--Check this.-->

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/admin-portal/organization-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the organization tab in the admin portal." lightbox="../media/goals/admin-portal/organization-page.png":::

- As a Viva Goals administrator, you can modify the org owner or org admin for any organization from the **Details** pane. For example, to add or remove administrators for an organization, select the **Admin** field in the **Details** pane, then search for and select the users you want to assign as org admins. You can assign multiple admins for an organization, but only one owner can be assigned for an organization.

- As a Viva Goals administrator, you can assign yourself as an owner or admin should there be a need to directly administrate the org. This gives you copmlete managerial control over an organization.
