# Goals Broadcast

Leaders of teams can broadcast updates to their teams at important checkpoints in the OKR lifecycle. Some of these could be: 

- At the conclusion of planning, when the OKRs are finalized. This will help you get the team aligned and focused on the plan for the upcoming time period.
- Sharing an update after an MBR, with a focus on progress, wins and next steps.
- Sharing an update post OKR closure, with a summary and score – with a focus on learnings and next steps. 

## How to use Goals Broadcast

This feature is available to all **admins** and **owners of teams** (including the org) in Viva Goals. Admins and owners can use the feature by using the “share an update” button from the share menu of the list/dashboard tab.

## Notifications

You will have an option to choose to not notify the members in the team/organization. Notifications are turned on by default. Turning the notifications off will stop emails from going out to all members.  

If you need to check which users receive the notifications, you can click on the team name to see the list of members.

Once you hit post, a new update is created in the updates tab.
