# Overview of Skills in Viva 

 Skills in Viva is an AI-powered service in the Microsoft Viva Suite that delivers personalized skills-based experiences throughout supported Microsoft 365 and Viva applications for employees, business leaders, and HR. 

It uses data from the [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/overview) and skills from the [LinkedIn Skills Graph](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/building-linkedin-s-skills-graph-to-power-a-skills-first-world) to predict a user’s skills and offer tailored skill suggestions, while providing you with a better understanding of your organization’s current workforce skills distribution. Learn more about [Skills in Viva](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/introducing-ai-powered-skills-in-microsoft-viva-a-new-way-to/ba-p/3947844). 



Future releases plan to include other signals, like expertise in Viva Topics and data from human capital management systems. 

If you’d like to learn more or apply for the Skills in Viva preview, contact your Microsoft representative. 

## Prerequisites 

To help ensure a productive private preview that enables Skills in Viva to meet and exceed your company's goals, the following are the requirements for private preview participation: 

1. Private preview must be deployed on a production tenant where users are spending at least 80% of their time on emails, documents, and other Microsoft 365 and Viva applications. 

2. More than 100 end users who are licensed for either Viva Suite or Viva Learning.  

3. End users included in the Skills private preview program have Viva Learning deployed and available for use.

> [!NOTE]
> - Private preview will be available in English language only. Default language for Viva Learning must also be English for this private preview 
> - All users in your tenant will lose “Interests” they have selected in Viva Learning when you enable skills.  This action is not reversible.
