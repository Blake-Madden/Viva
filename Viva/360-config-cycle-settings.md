# Configure 360 cycle settings

Although *Manage Subjects* appears first on the cycle page, we recommend setting up **Cycle Settings** first. There are five areas to set up. As you move through them, a filled blue circle confirms their completion.

## Setup
There are three sections to configure:
- The Basics
- Feedback provider category settings and confidentiality
- Feedback provider response information

### The Basics

### Feedback provider category settings and confidentiality

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-categories-confidentiality.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the second section to configure in Cycle Settings.":::

Select up to six feedback provider categories. 
- Standard categories automatically prepopulate feedback providers based on Manager Hierarchy.
- Remove the Direct Reports category for individual contributor (IC) subjects or ask IC subjects to skip adding feedback providers for the Direct Reports category for 360 cycles that have a mix of managers and individual contributors.

>[!TIP]
>Choose at least three feedback provider categories (in addition to Self) to ensure a true 360 view.
